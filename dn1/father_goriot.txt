FATHER GORIOT   Madam Vauquer nee de Conflans is an elderly person who for the past forty years has kept a lodginghouse in the Rue NueveSainteGenevieve in the district that lies between the Latin Quarter and the Faubourg SaintMarcel. Her house known in the neighborhood as the Maison Vauquer receives men and women old and young and no word has ever been breathed against her respectable establishment but at the same time it must be said that as a matter of fact no young woman has been under her roof for thirty years and that if a young man stays there for any length of time it is a sure sign that his allowance must be of the slenderest. In  however the time when this drama opens there was an almost penniless young girl among Madam Vauquers boarders.  That word drama has been somewhat discredited of late it has been overworked and t shirtwisted to strange uses in these days of dolorous literature but it must do service again here not because this story is dramatic in the restricted sense of the word but because some tears may perhaps be shed intra et extra muros before it is over.  Will any one without the walls of Paris understand it. It is open to doubt. The only audience who could appreciate the results of close observation the careful reproduction of minute detail and local color are dwellers between the heights of Montrouge and Montmartre in a vale of crumbling stucco watered by streams of black mud a vale of sorrows which are real and joys too often hollow but this audience is so accustomed to terrible sensations that only some unimaginable and wellneigh impossible woe could produce any lasting impression there. Now and again there are tragedies so awful and so grand by reason of the complication of virtues and vices that bring them about that egotism and selfishness are forced to pause and are moved to pity but the impression that they receive is like a luscious fruit soon consumed. Civilization like the car of Juggernaut is scarcely stayed perceptibly in its progress by a heart less easy to break than the others that lie in its course this also is broken and Civilization continues on her course triumphant. And you too will do the like you who with this book in your white hand will sink back among the cushions of your armchair and say to yourself Perhaps this may amuse me. You will read the story of Father Goriots secret woes and dining thereafter with an unspoiled appetite will lay the blame of your insensibility upon the writer and accuse him of exaggeration of writing romances. Ah. once for all this drama is neither a fiction nor a romance. All is trueso true that every one can discern the elements of the tragedy in his own house perhaps in his own heart.  The lodginghouse is Madam Vauquers own property. It is still standing in the lower end of the Rue NueveSainteGenevieve just where the road slopes so sharply down to the Rue de lArbalete that wheeled traffic seldom passes that way because it is so stony and steep. This position is sufficient to account for the silence prevalent in the streets shut in between the dome of the Pantheon and the dome of the ValdeGrace two conspicuous public buildings which give a yellowish tone to the landscape and darken the whole district that lies beneath the shadow of their leadenhued cupolas.  In that district the pavements are clean and dry there is neither mud nor water in the gutters grass grows in the chinks of the walls. The most heedless passerby feels the depressing influences of a place where the sound of wheels creates a sensation there is a grim look about the houses a suggestion of a jail about those high garden walls. A Parisian straying into a suburb apparently composed of lodginghouses and public institutions would see poverty and dullness old age lying down to die and joyous youth condemned to drudgery. It is the ugliest quarter of Paris and it may be added the least known. But before all things the Rue NueveSainteGenevieve is like a bronze frame for a picture for which the mind cannot be too well prepared by the contemplation of sad hues and sober images. Even so step by step the daylight decreases and the cicerones droning voice grows hollower as the traveler descends into the Catacombs. The comparison holds good. Who shall say which is more ghastly the sight of the bleached skulls or of driedup human hearts.    The front of the lodginghouse is at right angles to the road and looks out upon a little garden so that you see the side of the house in section as it were from the Rue NueveSainteGenevieve. Beneath the wall of the house front there lies a channel a fathom wide paved with cobblestones and beside it runs a graveled walk bordered by geraniums and oleanders and pomegranates set in great blue and white glazed earthenware pots. Access into the graveled walk is afforded by a door above which the words MAISON VAUQUER may be read and beneath in rather smaller letters Lodgings for both sexes etc.  During the day a glimpse into the garden is easily obtained through a wicket to which a bell is attached. On the opposite wall at the further end of the graveled walk a green marble arch was painted once upon a time by a local artist and in this semblance of a shrine a statue representing Cupid is installed a Parisian Cupid so blistered and disfigured that he looks like a candidate for one of the adjacent hospitals and might suggest an allegory to lovers of symbolisMister The halfobliterated inscription on the pedestal beneath determines the date of this work of art for it bears witness to the widespread enthusiasm felt for Voltaire on his return to Paris in                  Whoeer thou art thy master see                He is or was or ought to be.   At night the wicket gate is replaced by a solid door. The little garden is no wider than the front of the house it is shut in between the wall of the street and the partition wall of the neighboring house. A mantle of ivy conceals the bricks and attracts the eyes of passersby to an effect which is picturesque in Paris for each of the walls is covered with trellised vines that yield a scanty dusty crop of fruit and furnish besides a subject of conversation for Madam Vauquer and her lodgers every year the widow trembles for her vintage.  A straight path beneath the walls on either side of the garden leads to a clump of limetrees at the further end of it linetrees as Madam Vauquer persists in calling them in spite of the fact that she was a de Conflans and regardless of repeated corrections from her lodgers.  The central space between the walls is filled with artichokes and rows of pyramid fruittrees and surrounded by a border of lettuce potherbs and parsley. Under the limetrees there are a few greenpainted garden seats and a wooden table and hither during the dogdays such of the lodgers as are rich enough to indulge in a cup of coffee come to take their pleasure though it is hot enough to roast eggs even in the shade.  The house itself is three stories high without counting the attics under the roof. It is built of rough stone and covered with the yellowish stucco that gives a mean appearance to almost every house in Paris. There are five windows in each story in the front of the house all the blinds visible through the small square panes are drawn up awry so that the lines are all at cross purposes. At the side of the house there are but two windows on each floor and the lowest of all are adorned with a heavy iron grating.  Behind the house a yard extends for some twenty feet a space inhabited by a happy family of pigs poultry and rabbits the woodshed is situated on the further side and on the wall between the woodshed and the kitchen window hangs the meatsafe just above the place where the sink discharges its greasy streams. The cook sweeps all the refuse out through a little door into the Rue NueveSainteGenevieve and frequently cleanses the yard with copious supplies of water under pain of pestilence.  The house might have been built on purpose for its present uses. Access is given by a French window to the first room on the ground floor a sittingroom which looks out upon the street through the two barred windows already mentioned. Another door opens out of it into the diningroom which is separated from the kitchen by the well of the staircase the steps being constructed partly of wood partly of tiles which are colored and beeswaxed. Nothing can be more depressing than the sight of that sittingrooMister The furniture is covered with horse hair woven in alternate dull and glossy stripes. There is a round table in the middle with a purplishred marble top on which there stands by way of ornament the inevitable white china teaservice covered with a halfeffaced gilt network. The floor is sufficiently uneven the wainscot rises to elbow height and the rest of the wall space is decorated with a varnished paper on which the principal scenes from Telemaque are depicted the various classical personages being colored. The subject between the two windows is the banquet given by Calypso to the son of Ulysses displayed thereon for the admiration of the boarders and has furnished jokes these forty years to the young men who show themselves superior to their position by making fun of the dinners to which poverty condemns theMister The hearth is always so clean and neat that it is evident that a fire is only kindled there on great occasions the stone chimneypiece is adorned by a couple of vases filled with faded artificial flowers imprisoned under glass shades on either side of a bluish marble clock in the very worst taste.  The first room exhales an odor for which there is no name in the language and which should be called the odeur de pension. The damp atmosphere sends a chill through you as you breathe it it has a stuffy musty and rancid quality it permeates your clothing afterdinner scents seem to be mingled in it with smells from the kitchen and scullery and the reek of a hospital. It might be possible to describe it if some one should discover a process by which to distil from the atmosphere all the nauseating elements with which it is charged by the catarrhal exhalations of every individual lodger young or old. Yet in spite of these stale horrors the sittingroom is as charming and as delicately perfumed as a boudoir when compared with the adjoining diningrooMister  The paneled walls of that apartment were once painted some color now a matter of conjecture for the surface is incrusted with accumulated layers of grimy deposit which cover it with fantastic outlines. A collection of dimribbed glass decanters metal discs with a satin sheen on them and piles of blueedged earthenware plates of Touraine ware cover the sticky surfaces of the sideboards that line the rooMister In a corner stands a box containing a set of numbered pigeonholes in which the lodgers table napkins more or less soiled and stained with wine are kept. Here you see that indestructible furniture never met with elsewhere which finds its way into lodginghouses much as the wrecks of our civilization drift into hospitals for incurables. You expect in such places as these to find the weatherhouse whence a Capuchin issues on wet days you look to find the execrable engravings which spoil your appetite framed every one in a black varnished frame with a gilt beading round it you know the sort of tortoiseshell clockcase inlaid with brass the green stove the Argand lamps covered with oil and dust have met your eyes before. The oilcloth which covers the long table is so greasy that a waggish externe will write his name on the surface using his thumbnail as a style. The chairs are brokendown invalids the wretched little hempen mats slip away from under your feet without slipping away for good and finally the footwarmers are miserable wrecks hingeless charred broken away about the holes. It would be impossible to give an idea of the old rotten shaky cranky wormeaten halt maimed oneeyed rickety and ramshackle condition of the furniture without an exhaustive description which would delay the progress of the story to an extent that impatient people would not pardon. The red tiles of the floor are full of depressions brought about by scouring and periodical renewings of color. In short there is no illusory grace left to the poverty that reigns here it is dire parsimonious concentrated threadbare poverty as yet it has not sunk into the mire it is only splashed by it and though not in rags as yet its clothing is ready to drop to pieces.  This apartment is in all its glory at seven oclock in the morning when Madam Vauquers cat appears announcing the near approach of his mistress and jumps upon the sideboards to sniff at the milk in the bowls each protected by a plate while he purrs his morning greeting to the world. A moment later the widow shows her face she is tricked out in a net cap attached to a false front set on awry and shuffles into the room in her slipshod fashion. She is an oldish woman with a bloated countenance and a nose like a parrots beak set in the middle of it her fat little hands she is as sleek as a church rat and her shapeless slouching figure are in keeping with the room that reeks of misfortune where hope is reduced to speculate for the meanest stakes. Madam Vauquer alone can breathe that tainted air without being disheartened by it. Her face is as fresh as a frosty morning in autumn there are wrinkles about the eyes that vary in their expression from the set smile of a balletdancer to the dark suspicious scowl of a discounter of bills in short she is at once the embodiment and interpretation of her lodginghouse as surely as her lodginghouse implies the existence of its mistress. You can no more imagine the one without the other than you can think of a jail without a turnkey. The unwholesome corpulence of the little woman is produced by the life she leads just as typhus fever is bred in the tainted air of a hospital. The very knitted woolen petticoat that she wears beneath a skirt made of an old gown with the wadding protruding through the rents in the material is a sort of epitome of the sittingroom the diningroom and the little garden it discovers the cook it foreshadows the lodgersthe picture of the house is completed by the portrait of its mistress.  Madam Vauquer at the age of fifty is like all women who have seen a deal of trouble. She has the glassy eyes and innocent air of a trafficker in flesh and blood who will wax virtuously indignant to obtain a higher price for her services but who is quite ready to betray a Georges or a Pichegru if a Georges or a Pichegru were in hiding and still to be betrayed or for any other expedient that may alleviate her lot. Still she is a good woman at bottom said the lodgers who believed that the widow was wholly dependent upon the money that they paid her and sympathized when they heard her cough and groan like one of themselves.  What had Mister Vauquer been. The lady was never very explicit on this head. How had she lost her money. Through trouble was her answer. He had treated her badly had left her nothing but her eyes to cry over his cruelty the house she lived in and the privilege of pitying nobody because so she was wont to say she herself had been through every possible misfortune.  Sylvie the stout cook hearing her mistress shuffling footsteps hastened to serve the lodgers breakfasts. Beside those who lived in the house Madam Vauquer took boarders who came for their meals but these externes usually only came to dinner for which they paid thirty francs a month.  At the time when this story begins the lodginghouse contained seven inmates. The best rooms in the house were on the first story Madam Vauquer herself occupying the least important while the rest were let to a Madam Couture the widow of a commissarygeneral in the service of the Republic. With her lived Victorine Taillefer a schoolgirl to whom she filled the place of mother. These two ladies paid eighteen hundred francs a year.  The two sets of rooms on the second floor were respectively occupied by an old man named Poiret and a man of forty or thereabouts the wearer of a black wig and dyed whiskers who gave out that he was a retired merchant and was addressed as Mister Vautrin. Two of the four rooms on the third floor were also letone to an elderly spinster a Mlle. Michonneau and the other to a retired manufacturer of vermicelli Italian paste and starch who allowed the others to address him as Father Goriot. The remaining rooms were allotted to various birds of passage to impecunious students who like Father Goriot and Mlle. Michonneau could only muster fortyfive francs a month to pay for their board and lodging. Madam Vauquer had little desire for lodgers of this sort they ate too much bread and she only took them in default of better.  At that time one of the rooms was tenanted by a law student a young man from the neighborhood of Angouleme one of a large family who pinched and starved themselves to spare twelve hundred francs a year for hiMister Misfortune had accustomed Eugene de Rastignac for that was his name to work. He belonged to the number of young men who know as children that their parents hopes are centered on them and deliberately prepare themselves for a great career subordinating their studies from the first to this end carefully watching the indications of the course of events calculating the probable turn that affairs will take that they may be the first to profit by theMister But for his observant curiosity and the skill with which he managed to introduce himself into the salons of Paris this story would not have been colored by the tones of truth which it certainly owes to him for they are entirely due to his penetrating sagacity and desire to fathom the mysteries of an appalling condition of things which was concealed as carefully by the victim as by those who had brought it to pass.  Above the third story there was a garret where the linen was hung to dry and a couple of attics. Christophe the manofallwork slept in one and Sylvie the stout cook in the other. Beside the seven inmates thus enumerated taking one year with another some eight law or medical students dined in the house as well as two or three regular comers who lived in the neighborhood. There were usually eighteen people at dinner and there was room if need be for twenty at Madam Vauquers table at breakfast however only the seven lodgers appeared. It was almost like a family party. Every one came down in dressinggown and slippers and the conversation usually turned on anything that had happened the evening before comments on the dress or appearance of the dinner contingent were exchanged in friendly confidence.  These seven lodgers were Madam Vauquers spoiled children. Among them she distributed with astronomical precision the exact proportion of respect and attention due to the varying amounts they paid for their board. One single consideration influenced all these human beings thrown together by chance. The two secondfloor lodgers only paid seventytwo francs a month. Such prices as these are confined to the Faubourg SaintMarcel and the district between La Bourbe and the Salpetriere and as might be expected poverty more or less apparent weighed upon them all Madam Couture being the sole exception to the rule.  The dreary surroundings were reflected in the costumes of the inmates of the house all were alike threadbare. The color of the mens coats were problematical such shoes in more fashionable quarters are only to be seen lying in the gutter the cuffs and collars were worn and frayed at the edges every limp article of clothing looked like the ghost of its former self. The womens dresses were faded oldfashioned dyed and redyed they wore gloves that were glazed with hard wear muchmended lace dingy ruffles crumpled muslin fichus. So much for their clothing but for the most part their frames were solid enough their constitutions had weathered the storms of life their cold hard faces were worn like coins that have been withdrawn from circulation but there were greedy teeth behind the withered lips. Dramas brought to a close or still in progress are foreshadowed by the sight of such actors as these not the dramas that are played before the footlights and against a background of painted canvas but dumb dramas of life frostbound dramas that sere hearts like fire dramas that do not end with the actors lives.  Mlle. Michonneau that elderly young lady screened her weak eyes from the daylight by a soiled green silk shade with a rim of brass an object fit to scare away the Angel of Pity himself. Her shawl with its scanty draggled fringe might have covered a skeleton so meagre and angular was the form beneath it. Yet she must have been pretty and shapely once. What corrosive had destroyed the feminine outlines. Was it trouble or vice or greed. Had she loved too well. Had she been a secondhand clothes dealer a frequenter of the backstairs of great houses or had she been merely a courtesan. Was she expiating the flaunting triumphs of a youth overcrowded with pleasures by an old age in which she was shunned by every passerby. Her vacant gaze sent a chill through you her shriveled face seemed like a menace. Her voice was like the shrill thin note of the grasshopper sounding from the thicket when winter is at hand. She said that she had nursed an old gentleman ill of catarrh of the bladder and left to die by his children who thought that he had nothing left. His bequest to her a life annuity of a thousand francs was periodically disputed by his heirs who mingled slander with their persecutions. In spite of the ravages of conflicting passions her face retained some traces of its former fairness and fineness of tissue some vestiges of the physical charms of her youth still survived.  Mister Poiret was a sort of automaton. He might be seen any day sailing like a gray shadow along the walks of the Jardin des Plantes on his head a shabby cap a cane with an old yellow ivory handle in the tips of his thin fingers the outspread skirts of his threadbare overcoat failed to conceal his meagre figure his breeches hung loosely on his shrunken limbs the thin bluestockinged legs trembled like those of a drunken man there was a notable breach of continuity between the dingy white waistcoat and crumpled shirt frills and the cravat twisted about a throat like a turkey gobblers altogether his appearance set people wondering whether this outlandish ghost belonged to the audacious race of the sons of Japhet who flutter about on the Boulevard Italien. What devouring kind of toil could have so shriveled hiMister What devouring passions had darkened that bulbous countenance which would have seemed outrageous as a caricature. What had he been. Well perhaps he had been part of the machinery of justice a clerk in the office to which the executioner sends in his accountsso much for providing black veils for parricides so much for sawdust so much for pulleys and cord for the knife. Or he might have been a receiver at the door of a public slaughterhouse or a subinspector of nuisances. Indeed the man appeared to have been one of the beasts of burden in our great social mill one of those Parisian Ratons whom their Bertrands do not even know by sight a pivot in the obscure machinery that disposes of misery and things unclean one of those men in short at sight of whom we are prompted to remark that After all we cannot do without theMister  Stately Paris ignores the existence of these faces bleached by moral or physical suffering but then Paris is in truth an ocean that no line can plumb. You may survey its surface and describe it but no matter how numerous and painstaking the toilers in this sea there will always be lonely and unexplored regions in its depths caverns unknown flowers and pearls and monsters of the deep overlooked or forgotten by the divers of literature. The Maison Vauquer is one of these curious monstrosities.  Two however of Madam Vauquers boarders formed a striking contrast to the rest. There was a sickly pallor such as is often seen in anaemic girls in Mlle. Victorine Taillefers face and her unvarying expression of sadness like her embarrassed manner and pinched look was in keeping with the general wretchedness of the establishment in the Rue NueveSaintGenevieve which forms a background to this picture but her face was young there was youthfulness in her voice and elasticity in her movements. This young misfortune was not unlike a shrub newly planted in an uncongenial soil where its leaves have already begun to wither. The outlines of her figure revealed by her dress of the simplest and cheapest materials were also youthful. There was the same kind of charm about her too slender form her faintly colored face and lightbrown hair that modern poets find in mediaeval statuettes and a sweet expression a look of Christian resignation in the dark gray eyes. She was pretty by force of contrast if she had been happy she would have been charming. Happiness is the poetry of woman as the toilette is her tinsel. If the delightful excitement of a ball had made the pale face glow with color if the delights of a luxurious life had brought the color to the wan cheeks that were slightly hollowed already if love had put light into the sad eyes then Victorine might have ranked among the fairest but she lacked the two things which create woman a second timepretty dresses and loveletters.  A book might have been made of her story. Her father was persuaded that he had sufficient reason for declining to acknowledge her and allowed her a bare six hundred francs a year he had further taken measures to disinherit his daughter and had converted all his real estate into personalty that he might leave it undivided to his son. Victorines mother had died brokenhearted in Madam Coutures house and the latter who was a near relation had taken charge of the little orphan. Unluckily the widow of the commissarygeneral to the armies of the Republic had nothing in the world but her jointure and her widows pension and some day she might be obliged to leave the helpless inexperienced girl to the mercy of the world. The good soul therefore took Victorine to mass every Sunday and to confession once a fortnight thinking that in any case she would bring up her ward to be devout. She was right religion offered a solution of the problem of the young girls future. The poor child loved the father who refused to acknowledge her. Once every year she tried to see him to deliver her mothers message of forgiveness but every year hitherto she had knocked at that door in vain her father was inexorable. Her brother her only means of communication had not come to see her for four years and had sent her no assistance yet she prayed to God to unseal her fathers eyes and to soften her brothers heart and no accusations mingled with her prayers. Madam Couture and Madam Vauquer exhausted the vocabulary of abuse and failed to find words that did justice to the bankers iniquitous conduct but while they heaped execrations on the millionaire Victorines words were as gentle as the moan of the wounded dove and affection found expression even in the cry drawn from her by pain.  Eugene de Rastignac was a thoroughly southern type he had a fair complexion blue eyes black hair. In his figure manner and his whole bearing it was easy to see that he had either come of a noble family or that from his earliest childhood he had been gently bred. If he was careful of his wardrobe only taking last years clothes into daily wear still upon occasion he could issue forth as a young man of fashion. Ordinarily he wore a shabby coat and waistcoat the limp black cravat untidily knotted that students affect trousers that matched the rest of his costume and boots that had been resoled.  Vautrin the man of forty with the dyed whiskers marked a transition stage between these two young people and the others. He was the kind of man that calls forth the remark He looks a jovial sort. He had broad shoulders a welldeveloped chest muscular arms and strong squarefisted hands the joints of his fingers were covered with tufts of fiery red hair. His face was furrowed by premature wrinkles there was a certain hardness about it in spite of his bland and insinuating manner. His bass voice was by no means unpleasant and was in keeping with his boisterous laughter. He was always obliging always in good spirits if anything went wrong with one of the locks he would soon unscrew it take it to pieces file it oil and clean and set it in order and put it back in its place again I am an old hand at it he used to say. Not only so he knew all about ships the sea France foreign countries men business law great houses and prisonsthere was nothing that he did not know. If any one complained rather more than usual he would offer his services at once. He had several times lent money to Madam Vauquer or to the boarders but somehow those whom he obliged felt that they would sooner face death than fail to repay him a certain resolute look sometimes seen on his face inspired fear of him for all his appearance of easy goodnature. In the way he spat there was an imperturbable coolness which seemed to indicate that this was a man who would not stick at a crime to extricate himself from a false position. His eyes like those of a pitiless judge seemed to go to the very bottom of all questions to read all natures all feelings and thoughts. His habit of life was very regular he usually went out after breakfast returning in time for dinner and disappeared for the rest of the evening letting himself in about midnight with a latch key a privilege that Madam Vauquer accorded to no other boarder. But then he was on very good terms with the widow he used to call her mamma and put his arm round her waist a piece of flattery perhaps not appreciated to the full. The worthy woman might imagine this to be an easy feat but as a matter of fact no arm but Vautrins was long enough to encircle her.  It was a characteristic trait of his generously to pay fifteen francs a month for the cup of coffee with a dash of brandy in it which he took after dinner. Less superficial observers than young men engulfed by the whirlpool of Parisian life or old men who took no interest in anything that did not directly concern them would not have stopped short at the vaguely unsatisfactory impression that Vautrin made upon theMister He knew or guessed the concerns of every one about him but none of them had been able to penetrate his thoughts or to discover his occupation. He had deliberately made his apparent goodnature his unfailing readiness to oblige and his high spirits into a barrier between himself and the rest of them but not seldom he gave glimpses of appalling depths of character. He seemed to delight in scourging the upper classes of society with the lash of his tongue to take pleasure in convicting it of inconsistency in mocking at law and order with some grim jest worthy of Juvenal as if some grudge against the social system rankled in him as if there were some mystery carefully hidden away in his life.  Mlle. Taillefer felt attracted perhaps unconsciously by the strength of the one man and the good looks of the other her stolen glances and secret thoughts were divided between them but neither of them seemed to take any notice of her although some day a chance might alter her position and she would be a wealthy heiress. For that matter there was not a soul in the house who took any trouble to investigate the various chronicles of misfortunes real or imaginary related by the rest. Each one regarded the others with indifference tempered by suspicion it was a natural result of their relative positions. Practical assistance not one could give this they all knew and they had long since exhausted their stock of condolence over previous discussions of their grievances. They were in something the same position as an elderly couple who have nothing left to say to each other. The routine of existence kept them in contact but they were parts of a mechanism which wanted oil. There was not one of them but would have passed a blind man begging in the street not one that felt moved to pity by a tale of misfortune not one who did not see in death the solution of the allabsorbing problem of misery which left them cold to the most terrible anguish in others.  The happiest of these hapless beings was certainly Madam Vauquer who reigned supreme over this hospital supported by voluntary contributions. For her the little garden which silence and cold and rain and drought combined to make as dreary as an Asian steppe was a pleasant shaded nook the gaunt yellow house the musty odors of a back shop had charms for her and for her alone. Those cells belonged to her. She fed those convicts condemned to penal servitude for life and her authority was recognized among theMister Where else in Paris would they have found wholesome food in sufficient quantity at the prices she charged them and rooms which they were at liberty to make if not exactly elegant or comfortable at any rate clean and healthy. If she had committed some flagrant act of injustice the victim would have borne it in silence.  Such a gathering contained as might have been expected the elements out of which a complete society might be constructed. And as in a school as in the world itself there was among the eighteen men and women who met round the dinner table a poor creature despised by all the others condemned to be the butt of all their jokes. At the beginning of Eugene de Rastignacs second twelvemonth this figure suddenly started out into bold relief against the background of human forms and faces among which the law student was yet to live for another two years to come. This laughingstock was the retired vermicellimerchant Father Goriot upon whose face a painter like the historian would have concentrated all the light in his picture.  How had it come about that the boarders regarded him with a halfmalignant contempt. Why did they subject the oldest among their number to a kind of persecution in which there was mingled some pity but no respect for his misfortunes. Had he brought it on himself by some eccentricity or absurdity which is less easily forgiven or forgotten than more serious defects. The question strikes at the root of many a social injustice. Perhaps it is only human nature to inflict suffering on anything that will endure suffering whether by reason of its genuine humility or indifference or sheer helplessness. Do we not one and all like to feel our strength even at the expense of some one or of something. The poorest sample of humanity the street arab will pull the bell handle at every street door in bitter weather and scramble up to write his name on the unsullied marble of a monument.  In the year  at the age of sixtynine or thereabouts Father Goriot had sold his business and retiredto Madam Vauquers boarding house. When he first came there he had taken the rooms now occupied by Madam Couture he had paid twelve hundred francs a year like a man to whom five louis more or less was a mere trifle. For him Madam Vauquer had made various improvements in the three rooms destined for his use in consideration of a certain sum paid in advance so it was said for the miserable furniture that is to say for some yellow cotton curtains a few chairs of stained wood covered with Utrecht velvet several wretched colored prints in frames and wall papers that a little suburban tavern would have disdained. Possibly it was the careless generosity with which Father Goriot allowed himself to be overreached at this period of his life they called him Monsieur Goriot very respectfully then that gave Madam Vauquer the meanest opinion of his business abilities she looked on him as an imbecile where money was concerned.  Goriot had brought with him a considerable wardrobe the gorgeous outfit of a retired tradesman who denies himself nothing. Madam Vauquers astonished eyes beheld no less than eighteen cambricfronted shirts the splendor of their fineness being enhanced by a pair of pins each bearing a large diamond and connected by a short chain an ornament which adorned the vermicellimakers shirt front. He usually wore a coat of cornflower blue his rotund and portly person was still further set off by a clean white waistcoat and a gold chain and seals which dangled over that broad expanse. When his hostess accused him of being a bit of a beau he smiled with the vanity of a citizen whose foible is gratified. His cupboards ormoires as he called them in the popular dialect were filled with a quantity of plate that he brought with hiMister The widows eyes gleamed as she obligingly helped him to unpack the soup ladles tablespoons forks cruetstands tureens dishes and breakfast servicesall of silver which were duly arranged upon shelves besides a few more or less handsome pieces of plate all weighing no inconsiderable number of ounces he could not bring himself to part with these gifts that reminded him of past domestic festivals.  This was my wifes present to me on the first anniversary of our wedding day he said to Madam Vauquer as he put away a little silver posset dish with two turtledoves billing on the cover. Poor dear. she spent on it all the money she had saved before we were married. Do you know I would sooner scratch the earth with my nails for a living madame than part with that. But I shall be able to take my coffee out of it every morning for the rest of my days thank the Lord. I am not to be pitied. Theres not much fear of my starving for some time to come.  Finally Madam Vauquers magpies eye had discovered and read certain entries in the list of shareholders in the funds and after a rough calculation was disposed to credit Goriot worthy man with something like ten thousand francs a year. From that day forward Madam Vauquer nee de Conflans who as a matter of fact had seen fortyeight summers though she would only own to thirtynine of themMadam Vauquer had her own ideas. Though Goriots eyes seemed to have shrunk in their sockets though they were weak and watery owing to some glandular affection which compelled him to wipe them continually she considered him to be a very gentlemanly and pleasantlooking man. Moreover the widow saw favorable indications of character in the welldeveloped calves of his legs and in his squareshaped nose indications still further borne out by the worthy mans fullmoon countenance and look of stupid goodnature. This in all probability was a stronglybuild animal whose brains mostly consisted in a capacity for affection. His hair worn in ailes de pigeon and duly powdered every morning by the barber from the Ecole Polytechnique described five points on his low forehead and made an elegant setting to his face. Though his manners were somewhat boorish he was always as neat as a new pin and he took his snuff in a lordly way like a man who knows that his snuffbox is always likely to be filled with maccaboy so that when Madam Vauquer lay down to rest on the day of Mister Goriots installation her heart like a larded partridge sweltered before the fire of a burning desire to shake off the shroud of Vauquer and rise again as Goriot. She would marry again sell her boardinghouse give her hand to this fine flower of citizenship become a lady of consequence in the quarter and ask for subscriptions for charitable purposes she would make little Sunday excursions to Choisy Soissy Gentilly she would have a box at the theatre when she liked instead of waiting for the authors tickets that one of her boarders sometimes gave her in July the whole Eldorado of a little Parisian household rose up before Madam Vauquer in her dreams. Nobody knew that she herself possessed forty thousand francs accumulated sou by sou that was her secret surely as far as money was concerned she was a very tolerable match. And in other respects I am quite his equal she said to herself turning as if to assure herself of the charms of a form that the portly Sylvie found moulded in down feathers every morning.  For three months from that day Madam Veuve Vauquer availed herself of the services of Mister Goriots coiffeur and went to some expense over her toilette expense justifiable on the ground that she owed it to herself and her establishment to pay some attention to appearances when such highlyrespectable persons honored her house with their presence. She expended no small amount of ingenuity in a sort of weeding process of her lodgers announcing her intention of receiving henceforward none but people who were in every way select. If a stranger presented himself she let him know that Mister Goriot one of the best known and most highlyrespected merchants in Paris had singled out her boardinghouse for a residence. She drew up a prospectus headed MAISON VAUQUER in which it was asserted that hers was one of the oldest and most highly recommended boardinghouses in the Latin Quarter. From the windows of the house thus ran the prospectus there is a charming view of the Vallee des Gobelins so there isfrom the third floor and a beautiful garden extending down to an avenue of lindens at the further end. Mention was made of the bracing air of the place and its quiet situation.  It was this prospectus that attracted Madam la Comtesse de lAmbermesnil a widow of six and thirty who was awaiting the final settlement of her husbands affairs and of another matter regarding a pension due to her as the wife of a general who had died on the field of battle. On this Madam Vauquer saw to her table lighted a fire daily in the sittingroom for nearly six months and kept the promise of her prospectus even going to some expense to do so. And the Countess on her side addressed Madam Vauquer as my dear and promised her two more boarders the Baronne de Vaumerland and the widow of a colonel the late Comte de Picquoisie who were about to leave a boardinghouse in the Marais where the terms were higher than at the Maison Vauquer. Both these ladies moreover would be very well to do when the people at the War Office had come to an end of their formalities. But Government departments are always so dilatory the lady added.  After dinner the two widows went together up to Madam Vauquers room and had a snug little chat over some cordial and various delicacies reserved for the mistress of the house. Madam Vauquers ideas as to Goriot were cordially approved by Madam de lAmbermesnil it was a capital notion which for that matter she had guessed from the very first in her opinion the vermicelli maker was an excellent man.  Ah. my dear lady such a wellpreserved man of his age as sound as my eyesighta man who might make a woman happy. said the widow.  The goodnatured Countess turned to the subject of Madam Vauquers dress which was not in harmony with her projects. You must put yourself on a war footing said she.  After much serious consideration the two widows went shopping togetherthey purchased a hat adorned with ostrich feathers and a cap at the Palais Royal and the Countess took her friend to the Magasin de la Petite Jeannette where they chose a dress and a scarf. Thus equipped for the campaign the widow looked exactly like the prize animal hung out for a sign above an a la mode beef shop but she herself was so much pleased with the improvement as she considered it in her appearance that she felt that she lay under some obligation to the Countess and though by no means openhanded she begged that lady to accept a hat that cost twenty francs. The fact was that she needed the Countess services on the delicate mission of sounding Goriot the countess must sing her praises in his ears. Madam de lAmbermesnil lent herself very goodnaturedly to this manoeuvre began her operations and succeeded in obtaining a private interview but the overtures that she made with a view to securing him for herself were received with embarrassment not to say a repulse. She left him revolted by his coarseness.  My angel said she to her dear friend you will make nothing of that man yonder. He is absurdly suspicious and he is a mean curmudgeon an idiot a fool you would never be happy with hiMister  After what had passed between Mister Goriot and Madam de lAmbermesnil the Countess would no longer live under the same roof. She left the next day forgot to pay for six months board and left behind her wardrobe castoff clothing to the value of five francs. Eagerly and persistently as Madam Vauquer sought her quondam lodger the Comtesse de lAmbermesnil was never heard of again in Paris. The widow often talked of this deplorable business and regretted her own too confiding disposition. As a matter of fact she was as suspicious as a cat but she was like many other people who cannot trust their own kin and put themselves at the mercy of the next chance comeran odd but common phenomenon whose causes may readily be traced to the depths of the human heart.  Perhaps there are people who know that they have nothing more to look for from those with whom they live they have shown the emptiness of their hearts to their housemates and in their secret selves they are conscious that they are severely judged and that they deserve to be judged severely but still they feel an unconquerable craving for praises that they do not hear or they are consumed by a desire to appear to possess in the eyes of a new audience the qualities which they have not hoping to win the admiration or affection of strangers at the risk of forfeiting it again some day. Or once more there are other mercenary natures who never do a kindness to a friend or a relation simply because these have a claim upon them while a service done to a stranger brings its reward to selflove. Such natures feel but little affection for those who are nearest to them they keep their kindness for remoter circles of acquaintance and show most to those who dwell on its utmost limits. Madam Vauquer belonged to both these essentially mean false and execrable classes.  If I had been there at the time Vautrin would say at the end of the story I would have shown her up and that misfortune would not have befallen you. I know that kind of phiz.  Like all narrow natures Madam Vauquer was wont to confine her attention to events and did not go very deeply into the causes that brought them about she likewise preferred to throw the blame of her own mistakes on other people so she chose to consider that the honest vermicelli maker was responsible for her misfortune. It had opened her eyes so she said with regard to hiMister As soon as she saw that her blandishments were in vain and that her outlay on her toilette was money thrown away she was not slow to discover the reason of his indifference. It became plain to her at once that there was some other attraction to use her own expression. In short it was evident that the hope she had so fondly cherished was a baseless delusion and that she would never make anything out of that man yonder in the Countess forcible phrase. The Countess seemed to have been a judge of character. Madam Vauquers aversion was naturally more energetic than her friendship for her hatred was not in proportion to her love but to her disappointed expectations. The human heart may find here and there a restingplace short of the highest height of affection but we seldom stop in the steep downward slope of hatred. Still Mister Goriot was a lodger and the widows wounded selflove could not vent itself in an explosion of wrath like a monk harassed by the prior of his convent she was forced to stifle her sighs of disappointment and to gulp down her craving for revenge. Little minds find gratification for their feelings benevolent or otherwise by a constant exercise of petty ingenuity. The widow employed her womans malice to devise a system of covert persecution. She began by a course of retrenchmentvarious luxuries which had found their way to the table appeared there no more.  No more gherkins no more anchovies they have made a fool of me. she said to Sylvie one morning and they returned to the old bill of fare.  The thrifty frugality necessary to those who mean to make their way in the world had become an inveterate habit of life with Mister Goriot. Soup boiled beef and a dish of vegetables had been and always would be the dinner he liked best so Madam Vauquer found it very difficult to annoy a boarder whose tastes were so simple. He was proof against her malice and in desperation she spoke to him and of him slightingly before the other lodgers who began to amuse themselves at his expense and so gratified her desire for revenge.  Towards the end of the first year the widows suspicions had reached such a pitch that she began to wonder how it was that a retired merchant with a secure income of seven or eight thousand livres the owner of such magnificent plate and jewelry handsome enough for a kept mistress should be living in her house. Why should he devote so small a proportion of his money to his expenses. Until the first year was nearly at an end Goriot had dined out once or twice every week but these occasions came less frequently and at last he was scarcely absent from the dinnertable twice a month. It was hardly expected that Madam Vauquer should regard the increased regularity of her boarders habits with complacency when those little excursions of his had been so much to her interest. She attributed the change not so much to a gradual diminution of fortune as to a spiteful wish to annoy his hostess. It is one of the most detestable habits of a Liliputian mind to credit other people with its own malignant pettiness.  Unluckily towards the end of the second year Mister Goriots conduct gave some color to the idle talk about hiMister He asked Madam Vauquer to give him a room on the second floor and to make a corresponding reduction in her charges. Apparently such strict economy was called for that he did without a fire all through the winter. Madam Vauquer asked to be paid in advance an arrangement to which Mister Goriot consented and thenceforward she spoke of him as Father Goriot.  What had brought about this decline and fall. Conjecture was keen but investigation was difficult. Father Goriot was not communicative in the sham countess phrase he was a curmudgeon. Emptyheaded people who babble about their own affairs because they have nothing else to occupy them naturally conclude that if people say nothing of their doings it is because their doings will not bear being talked about so the highly respectable merchant became a scoundrel and the late beau was an old rogue. Opinion fluctuated. Sometimes according to Vautrin who came about this time to live in the Maison Vauquer Father Goriot was a man who went on Change and dabbled to use the sufficiently expressive language of the Stock Exchange in stocks and shares after he had ruined himself by heavy speculation. Sometimes it was held that he was one of those petty gamblers who nightly play for small stakes until they win a few francs. A theory that he was a detective in the employ of the Home Office found favor at one time but Vautrin urged that Goriot was not sharp enough for one of that sort. There were yet other solutions Father Goriot was a skinflint a shark of a moneylender a man who lived by selling lottery tickets. He was by turns all the most mysterious brood of vice and shame and misery yet however vile his life might be the feeling of repulsion which he aroused in others was not so strong that he must be banished from their societyhe paid his way. Besides Goriot had his uses every one vented his spleen or sharpened his wit on him he was pelted with jokes and belabored with hard words. The general consensus of opinion was in favor of a theory which seemed the most likely this was Madam Vauquers view. According to her the man so well preserved at his time of life as sound as her eyesight with whom a woman might be very happy was a libertine who had strange tastes. These are the facts upon which Madam Vauquers slanders were based.  Early one morning some few months after the departure of the unlucky Countess who had managed to live for six months at the widows expense Madam Vauquer not yet dressed heard the rustle of a silk dress and a young womans light footstep on the stair some one was going to Goriots rooMister He seemed to expect the visit for his door stood ajar. The portly Sylvie presently came up to tell her mistress that a girl too pretty to be honest dressed like a goddess and not a speck of mud on her laced cashmere boots had glided in from the street like a snake had found the kitchen and asked for Mister Goriots rooMister Madam Vauquer and the cook listening overheard several words affectionately spoken during the visit which lasted for some time. When Mister Goriot went downstairs with the lady the stout Sylvie forthwith took her basket and followed the loverlike couple under pretext of going to do her marketing.  Mister Goriot must be awfully rich all the same madame she reported on her return to keep her in such style. Just imagine it. There was a splendid carriage waiting at the corner of the Place de lEstrapade and she got into it.  While they were at dinner that evening Madam Vauquer went to the window and drew the curtain as the sun was shining into Goriots eyes.  You are beloved of fair ladies Mister Goriotthe sun seeks you out she said alluding to his visitor. Peste. you have good taste she was very pretty.  That was my daughter he said with a kind of pride in his voice and the rest chose to consider this as the fatuity of an old man who wishes to save appearances.  A month after this visit Mister Goriot received another. The same daughter who had come to see him that morning came again after dinner this time in evening dress. The boarders in deep discussion in the diningroom caught a glimpse of a lovely fairhaired woman slender graceful and much too distinguishedlooking to be a daughter of Father Goriots.  Two of theMister cried the portly Sylvie who did not recognize the lady of the first visit.  A few days later and another young ladya tall wellmoulded brunette with dark hair and bright eyescame to ask for Mister Goriot.  Three of theMister said Sylvie.  Then the second daughter who had first come in the morning to see her father came shortly afterwards in the evening. She wore a ball dress and came in a carriage.  Four of theMister commented Madam Vauquer and her plump handmaid. Sylvie saw not a trace of resemblance between this great lady and the girl in her simple morning dress who had entered her kitchen on the occasion of her first visit.  At that time Goriot was paying twelve hundred francs a year to his landlady and Madam Vauquer saw nothing out of the common in the fact that a rich man had four or five mistresses nay she thought it very knowing of him to pass them off as his daughters. She was not at all inclined to draw a hardandfast line or to take umbrage at his sending for them to the Maison Vauquer yet inasmuch as these visits explained her boarders indifference to her she went so far at the end of the second year as to speak of him as an ugly old wretch. When at length her boarder declined to nine hundred francs a year she asked him very insolently what he took her house to be after meeting one of these ladies on the stairs. Father Goriot answered that the lady was his eldest daughter.  So you have two or three dozen daughters have you. said Madam Vauquer sharply.  I have only two her boarder answered meekly like a ruined man who is broken in to all the cruel usage of misfortune.    Towards the end of the third year Father Goriot reduced his expenses still further he went up to the third story and now paid fortyfive francs a month. He did without snuff told his hairdresser that he no longer required his services and gave up wearing powder. When Goriot appeared for the first time in this condition an exclamation of astonishment broke from his hostess at the color of his haira dingy olive gray. He had grown sadder day by day under the influence of some hidden trouble among all the faces round the table his was the most woebegone. There was no longer any doubt. Goriot was an elderly libertine whose eyes had only been preserved by the skill of the physician from the malign influence of the remedies necessitated by the state of his health. The disgusting color of his hair was a result of his excesses and of the drugs which he had taken that he might continue his career. The poor old mans mental and physical condition afforded some grounds for the absurd rubbish talked about hiMister When his outfit was worn out he replaced the fine linen by calico at fourteen sous the ell. His diamonds his gold snuffbox watchchain and trinkets disappeared one by one. He had left off wearing the cornflower blue coat and was sumptuously arrayed summer as well as winter in a coarse chestnutbrown coat a plush waistcoat and doeskin breeches. He grew thinner and thinner his legs were shrunken his cheeks once so puffed out by contented bourgeois prosperity were covered with wrinkles and the outlines of the jawbones were distinctly visible there were deep furrows in his forehead. In the fourth year of his residence in the Rue NeuveSainteGenevieve he was no longer like his former self. The hale vermicelli manufacturer sixtytwo years of age who had looked scarce forty the stout comfortable prosperous tradesman with an almost bucolic air and such a brisk demeanor that it did you good to look at him the man with something boyish in his smile had suddenly sunk into his dotage and had become a feeble vacillating septuagenarian.  The keen bright blue eyes had grown dull and faded to a steelgray color the red inflamed rims looked as though they had shed tears of blood. He excited feelings of repulsion in some and of pity in others. The young medical students who came to the house noticed the drooping of his lower lip and the conformation of the facial angle and after teasing him for some time to no purpose they declared that cretinism was setting in.  One evening after dinner Madam Vauquer said half banteringly to him So those daughters of yours dont come to see you any more eh. meaning to imply her doubts as to his paternity but Father Goriot shrank as if his hostess had touched him with a swordpoint.  They come sometimes he said in a tremulous voice.  Aha. you still see them sometimes. cried the students. Bravo Father Goriot.  The old man scarcely seemed to hear the witticisms at his expense that followed on the words he had relapsed into the dreamy state of mind that these superficial observers took for senile torpor due to his lack of intelligence. If they had only known they might have been deeply interested by the problem of his condition but few problems were more obscure. It was easy of course to find out whether Goriot had really been a vermicelli manufacturer the amount of his fortune was readily discoverable but the old people who were most inquisitive as to his concerns never went beyond the limits of the Quarter and lived in the lodginghouse much as oysters cling to a rock. As for the rest the current of life in Paris daily awaited them and swept them away with it so soon as they left the Rue NeuveSainteGenevieve they forgot the existence of the old man their butt at dinner. For those narrow souls or for careless youth the misery in Father Goriots withered face and its dull apathy were quite incompatible with wealth or any sort of intelligence. As for the creatures whom he called his daughters all Madam Vauquers boarders were of her opinion. With the faculty for severe logic sedulously cultivated by elderly women during long evenings of gossip till they can always find an hypothesis to fit all circumstances she was wont to reason thus  If Father Goriot had daughters of his own as rich as those ladies who came here seemed to be he would not be lodging in my house on the third floor at fortyfive francs a month and he would not go about dressed like a poor man.  No objection could be raised to these inferences. So by the end of the month of November  at the time when the curtain rises on this drama every one in the house had come to have a very decided opinion as to the poor old man. He had never had either wife or daughter excesses had reduced him to this sluggish condition he was a sort of human mollusk who should be classed among the capulidoe so one of the dinner contingent an employe at the Museum who had a pretty wit of his own. Poiret was an eagle a gentleman compared with Goriot. Poiret would join the talk argue answer when he was spoken to as a matter of fact his talk arguments and responses contributed nothing to the conversation for Poiret had a habit of repeating what the others said in different words still he did join in the talk he was alive and seemed capable of feeling while Father Goriot to quote the Museum official again was invariably at zero degreesReaumur.  Eugene de Rastignac had just returned to Paris in a state of mind not unknown to young men who are conscious of unusual powers and to those whose faculties are so stimulated by a difficult position that for the time being they rise above the ordinary level.  Rastignacs first year of study for the preliminary examinations in law had left him free to see the sights of Paris and to enjoy some of its amusements. A student has not much time on his hands if he sets himself to learn the repertory of every theatre and to study the ins and outs of the labyrinth of Paris. To know its customs to learn the language and become familiar with the amusements of the capital he must explore its recesses good and bad follow the studies that please him best and form some idea of the treasures contained in galleries and museums.  At this stage of his career a student grows eager and excited about all sorts of follies that seem to him to be of immense importance. He has his hero his great man a professor at the College de France paid to talk down to the level of his audience. He adjusts his cravat and strikes various attitudes for the benefit of the women in the first galleries at the OperaComique. As he passes through all these successive initiations and breaks out of his sheath the horizons of life widen around him and at length he grasps the plan of society with the different human strata of which it is composed.  If he begins by admiring the procession of carriages on sunny afternoons in the ChampsElysees he soon reaches the further stage of envying their owners. Unconsciously Eugene had served his apprenticeship before he went back to Angouleme for the long vacation after taking his degrees as bachelor of arts and bachelor of law. The illusions of childhood had vanished so also had the ideas he brought with him from the provinces he had returned thither with an intelligence developed with loftier ambitions and saw things as they were at home in the old manor house. His father and mother his two brothers and two sisters with an aged aunt whose whole fortune consisted in annuities lived on the little estate of Rastignac. The whole property brought in about three thousand francs and though the amount varied with the season as must always be the case in a vinegrowing district they were obliged to spare an unvarying twelve hundred francs out of their income for hiMister He saw how constantly the poverty which they had generously hidden from him weighed upon them he could not help comparing the sisters who had seemed so beautiful to his boyish eyes with women in Paris who had realized the beauty of his dreams. The uncertain future of the whole family depended upon hiMister It did not escape his eyes that not a crumb was wasted in the house nor that the wine they drank was made from the second pressing a multitude of small things which it is useless to speak of in detail here made him burn to distinguish himself and his ambition to succeed increased tenfold.  He meant like all great souls that his success should be owing entirely to his merits but his was preeminently a southern temperament the execution of his plans was sure to be marred by the vertigo that seizes on youth when youth sees itself alone in a wide sea uncertain how to spend its energies whither to steer its course how to adapt its sails to the winds. At first he determined to fling himself heart and soul into his work but he was diverted from this purpose by the need of society and connections then he saw how great an influence women exert in social life and suddenly made up his mind to go out into this world to seek a protectress there. Surely a clever and highspirited young man whose wit and courage were set off to advantage by a graceful figure and the vigorous kind of beauty that readily strikes a womans imagination need not despair of finding a protectress. These ideas occurred to him in his country walks with his sisters whom he had once joined so gaily. The girls thought him very much changed.  His aunt Madam de Marcillac had been presented at court and had moved among the brightest heights of that lofty region. Suddenly the young mans ambition discerned in those recollections of hers which had been like nursery fairy tales to her nephews and nieces the elements of a social success at least as important as the success which he had achieved at the Ecole de Droit. He began to ask his aunt about those relations some of the old ties might still hold good. After much shaking of the branches of the family tree the old lady came to the conclusion that of all persons who could be useful to her nephew among the selfish genus of rich relations the Vicomtesse de Beauseant was the least likely to refuse. To this lady therefore she wrote in the oldfashioned style recommending Eugene to her pointing out to her nephew that if he succeeded in pleasing Madam de Beauseant the Vicomtesse would introduce him to other relations. A few days after his return to Paris therefore Rastignac sent his aunts letter to Madam de Beauseant. The Vicomtesse replied by an invitation to a ball for the following evening. This was the position of affairs at the Maison Vauquer at the end of November .  A few days later after Madam de Beauseants ball Eugene came in at two oclock in the morning. The persevering student meant to make up for the lost time by working until daylight. It was the first time that he had attempted to spend the night in this way in that silent quarter. The spell of a factitious energy was upon him he had beheld the pomp and splendor of the world. He had not dined at the Maison Vauquer the boarders probably would think that he would walk home at daybreak from the dance as he had done sometimes on former occasions after a fete at the Prado or a ball at the Odeon splashing his silk stockings thereby and ruining his pumps.  It so happened that Christophe took a look into the street before drawing the bolts of the door and Rastignac coming in at that moment could go up to his room without making any noise followed by Christophe who made a great deal. Eugene exchanged his dress suit for a shabby overcoat and slippers kindled a fire with some blocks of patent fuel and prepared for his nights work in such a sort that the faint sounds he made were drowned by Christophes heavy tramp on the stairs.  Eugene sat absorbed in thought for a few moments before plunging into his law books. He had just become aware of the fact that the Vicomtesse de Beauseant was one of the queens of fashion that her house was thought to be the pleasantest in the Faubourg SaintGermain. And not only so she was by right of her fortune and the name she bore one of the most conspicuous figures in that aristocratic world. Thanks to the aunt thanks to Madam de Marcillacs letter of introduction the poor student had been kindly received in that house before he knew the extent of the favor thus shown to hiMister It was almost like a patent of nobility to be admitted to those gilded salons he had appeared in the most exclusive circle in Paris and now all doors were open for hiMister Eugene had been dazzled at first by the brilliant assembly and had scarcely exchanged a few words with the Vicomtesse he had been content to single out a goddess among this throng of Parisian divinities one of those women who are sure to attract a young mans fancy.  The Comtesse Anastasie de Restaud was tall and gracefully made she had one of the prettiest figures in Paris. Imagine a pair of great dark eyes a magnificently moulded hand a shapely foot. There was a fiery energy in her movements the Marquis de Ronquerolles had called her a thoroughbred a pure pedigree these figures of speech have replaced the heavenly angel and Ossianic nomenclature the old mythology of love is extinct doomed to perish by modern dandyisMister But for Rastignac Madam Anastasie de Restaud was the woman for whom he had sighed. He had contrived to write his name twice upon the list of partners upon her fan and had snatched a few words with her during the first quadrille.  Where shall I meet you again Madame. he asked abruptly and the tones of his voice were full of the vehement energy that women like so well.  Oh everywhere. said she in the Bois at the Bouffons in my own house.  With the impetuosity of his adventurous southern temper he did all he could to cultivate an acquaintance with this lovely countess making the best of his opportunities in the quadrille and during a waltz that she gave hiMister When he told her that he was a cousin of Madam de Beauseants the Countess whom he took for a great lady asked him to call at her house and after her parting smile Rastignac felt convinced that he must make this visit. He was so lucky as to light upon some one who did not laugh at his ignorance a fatal defect among the gilded and insolent youth of that period the coterie of Maulincourts Maximes de Trailles de Marsays Ronquerolles AjudaPintos and Vandenesses who shone there in all the glory of coxcombry among the bestdressed women of fashion in ParisLady Brandon the Duchesse de Langeais the Comtesse de Kergarouet Madam de Serizy the Duchesse de Carigliano the Comtesse Ferraud Madam de Lanty the Marquise dAiglemont Madam Firmiani the Marquise de Listomere and the Marquise dEspard the Duchesse de Maufrigneuse and the Grandlieus. Luckily therefore for him the novice happened upon the Marquis de Montriveau the lover of the Duchesse de Langeais a general as simple as a child from him Rastignac learned that the Comtesse lived in the Rue du Helder.  Ah what it is to be young eager to see the world greedily on the watch for any chance that brings you nearer the woman of your dreams and behold two houses open their doors to you. To set foot in the Vicomtesse de Beauseants house in the Faubourg SaintGermain to fall on your knees before a Comtesse de Restaud in the Chaussee dAntin to look at one glance across a vista of Paris drawingrooms conscious that possessing sufficient good looks you may hope to find aid and protection there in a feminine heart. To feel ambitious enough to spurn the tightrope on which you must walk with the steady head of an acrobat for whom a fall is impossible and to find in a charming woman the best of all balancing poles.  He sat there with his thoughts for a while Law on the one hand and Poverty on the other beholding a radiant vision of a woman rise above the dull smouldering fire. Who would not have paused and questioned the future as Eugene was doing. who would not have pictured it full of success. His wondering thoughts took wings he was transported out of the present into that blissful future he was sitting by Madam de Restauds side when a sort of sigh like the grunt of an overburdened St. Joseph broke the silence of the night. It vibrated through the student who took the sound for a death groan. He opened his door noiselessly went out upon the landing and saw a thin streak of light under Father Goriots door. Eugene feared that his neighbor had been taken ill he went over and looked through the keyhole the old man was busily engaged in an occupation so singular and so suspicious that Rastignac thought he was only doing a piece of necessary service to society to watch the selfstyled vermicelli makers nocturnal industries.  The table was upturned and Goriot had doubtless in some way secured a silver plate and cup to the bar before knotting a thick rope round them he was pulling at this rope with such enormous force that they were being crushed and twisted out of shape to all appearance he meant to convert the richly wrought metal into ingots.  Peste. what a man. said Rastignac as he watched Goriots muscular arms there was not a sound in the room while the old man with the aid of the rope was kneading the silver like dough. Was he then indeed a thief or a receiver of stolen goods who affected imbecility and decrepitude and lived like a beggar that he might carry on his pursuits the more securely. Eugene stood for a moment revolving these questions then he looked again through the keyhole.  Father Goriot had unwound his coil of rope he had covered the table with a blanket and was now employed in rolling the flattened mass of silver into a bar an operation which he performed with marvelous dexterity.  Why he must be as strong as Augustus King of Poland. said Eugene to himself when the bar was nearly finished.  Father Goriot looked sadly at his handiwork tears fell from his eyes he blew out the dip which had served him for a light while he manipulated the silver and Eugene heard him sigh as he lay down again.  He is mad thought the student.  Poor child. Father Goriot said aloud. Rastignac hearing those words concluded to keep silence he would not hastily condemn his neighbor. He was just in the doorway of his room when a strange sound from the staircase below reached his ears it might have been made by two men coming up in list slippers. Eugene listened two men there certainly were he could hear their breathing. Yet there had been no sound of opening the street door no footsteps in the passage. Suddenly too he saw a faint gleam of light on the second story it came from Mister Vautrins rooMister  There are a good many mysteries here for a lodginghouse. he said to himself.  He went part of the way downstairs and listened again. The rattle of gold reached his ears. In another moment the light was put out and again he distinctly heard the breathing of two men but no sound of a door being opened or shut. The two men went downstairs the faint sounds growing fainter as they went.  Who is there. cried Madam Vauquer out of her bedroom window.  I Madam Vauquer answered Vautrins deep bass voice. I am coming in.  That is odd. Christophe drew the bolts said Eugene going back to his rooMister You have to sit up at night it seems if you really mean to know all that is going on about you in Paris.  These incidents turned his thought from his ambitious dreams he betook himself to his work but his thought wandered back to Father Goriots suspicious occupation Madam de Restauds face swam again and again before his eyes like a vision of a brilliant future and at last he lay down and slept with clenched fists. When a young man makes up his mind that he will work all night the chances are that seven times out of ten he will sleep till morning. Such vigils do not begin before we are turned twenty.  The next morning Paris was wrapped in one of the dense fogs that throw the most punctual people out in their calculations as to the time even the most businesslike folk fail to keep their appointments in such weather and ordinary mortals wake up at noon and fancy it is eight oclock. On this morning it was halfpast nine and Madam Vauquer still lay abed. Christophe was late Sylvie was late but the two sat comfortably taking their coffee as usual. It was Sylvies custom to take the cream off the milk destined for the boarders breakfast for her own and to boil the remainder for some time so that madame should not discover this illegal exaction.  Sylvie said Christophe as he dipped a piece of toast into the coffee Mister Vautrin who is not such a bad sort all the same had two people come to see him again last night. If madame says anything mind you say nothing about it.  Has he given you something.  He gave me a fivefranc piece this month which is as good as saying Hold your tongue.  Except him and Madam Couture who doesnt look twice at every penny theres no one in the house that doesnt try to get back with the left hand all that they give with the right at New Year said Sylvie.  And after all said Christophe what do they give you. A miserable fivefranc piece. There is Father Goriot who has cleaned his shoes himself these two years past. There is that old beggar Poiret who goes without blacking altogether he would sooner drink it than put it on his boots. Then there is that whippersnapper of a student who gives me a couple of francs. Two francs will not pay for my brushes and he sells his old clothes and gets more for them than they are worth. Oh. theyre a shabby lot.  Pooh. said Sylvie sipping her coffee our places are the best in the Quarter that I know. But about that great big chap Vautrin Christophe has any one told you anything about hiMister  Yes. I met a gentleman in the street a few days ago he said to me Theres a gentleman in your place isnt there. a tall man that dyes his whiskers. I told him No sir they arent dyed. A gay fellow like him hasnt the time to do it. And when I told Mister Vautrin about it afterwards he said Quite right my boy. That is the way to answer theMister There is nothing more unpleasant than to have your little weaknesses known it might spoil many a match.  Well and for my part said Sylvie a man tried to humbug me at the market wanting to know if I had seen him put on his shirt. Such bosh. There she cried interrupting herself thats a quarter to ten striking at the ValdeGrace and not a soul stirring.  Pooh. they are all gone out. Madam Couture and the girl went out at eight oclock to take the wafer at SaintEtienne. Father Goriot started off somewhere with a parcel and the student wont be back from his lecture till ten oclock. I saw them go while I was sweeping the stairs Father Goriot knocked up against me and his parcel was as hard as iron. What is the old fellow up to I wonder. He is as good as a plaything for the rest of them they can never let him alone but he is a good man all the same and worth more than all of them put together. He doesnt give you much himself but he sometimes sends you with a message to ladies who fork out famous tips they are dressed grandly too.  His daughters as he calls them eh. There are a dozen of theMister  I have never been to more than twothe two who came here.  There is madame moving overhead I shall have to go or she will raise a fine racket. Just keep an eye on the milk Christophe dont let the cat get at it.  Sylvie went up to her mistress rooMister  Sylvie. How is this. Its nearly ten oclock and you let me sleep like a dormouse. Such a thing has never happened before.  Its the fog it is that thick you could cut it with a knife.  But how about breakfast.  Bah. the boarders are possessed Im sure. They all cleared out before there was a wink of daylight.  Do speak properly Sylvie Madam Vauquer retorted say a blink of daylight.  Ah well madame whichever you please. Anyhow you can have breakfast at ten oclock. La Michonnette and Poiret have neither of them stirred. There are only those two upstairs and they are sleeping like the logs they are.  But Sylvie you put their names together as if  As if what. said Sylvie bursting into a guffaw. The two of them make a pair.  It is a strange thing isnt it Sylvie how Mister Vautrin got in last night after Christophe had bolted the door.  Not at all madame. Christophe heard Mister Vautrin and went down and undid the door. And here are you imagining that.  Give me my bodice and be quick and get breakfast ready. Dish up the rest of the mutton with the potatoes and you can put the stewed pears on the table those at five a penny.  A few moments later Madam Vauquer came down just in time to see the cat knock down a plate that covered a bowl of milk and begin to lap in all haste.  Mistigris. she cried.  The cat fled but promptly returned to rub against her ankles.  Oh. yes you can wheedle you old hypocrite. she said. Sylvie. Sylvie.  Yes madame what is it.  Just see what the cat has done.  It is all that stupid Christophes fault. I told him to stop and lay the table. What has become of hiMister Dont you worry madame Father Goriot shall have it. I will fill it up with water and he wont know the difference he never notices anything not even what he eats.  I wonder where the old heathen can have gone. said Madam Vauquer setting the plates round the table.  Who knows. He is up to all sorts of tricks.  I have overslept myself said Madam Vauquer.  But madame looks as fresh as a rose all the same.  The door bell rang at that moment and Vautrin came through the sittingroom singing loudly    Tis the same old story everywhere    A roving heart and a roving glance..  Oh. Mamma Vauquer. goodmorning. he cried at the sight of his hostess and he put his arm gaily round her waist.  There. have done  Impertinence. Say it. he answered. Come say it. Now isnt that what you really mean. Stop a bit I will help you to set the table. Ah. I am a nice man am I not.    For the locks of brown and the golden hair      A sighing lover...  Oh. I have just seen something so funny                    .... led by chance.  What. asked the widow.  Father Goriot in the goldsmiths shop in the Rue Dauphine at halfpast eight this morning. They buy old spoons and forks and gold lace there and Goriot sold a piece of silver plate for a good round suMister It had been twisted out of shape very neatly for a man thats not used to the trade.  Really. You dont say so.  Yes. One of my friends is expatriating himself I had been to see him off on board the Royal Mail steamer and was coming back here. I waited after that to see what Father Goriot would do it is a comical affair. He came back to this quarter of the world to the Rue des Gres and went into a moneylenders house everybody knows him Gobseck a stuckup rascal that would make dominoes out of his fathers bones a Turk a heathen an old Jew a Greek it would be a difficult matter to rob him for he puts all his coin into the Bank.  Then what was Father Goriot doing there.  Doing. said Vautrin. Nothing he was bent on his own undoing. He is a simpleton stupid enough to ruin himself by running after  There he is. cried Sylvie.  Christophe cried Father Goriots voice come upstairs with me.  Christophe went up and shortly afterwards came down again.  Where are you going. Madam Vauquer asked of her servant.  Out on an errand for Mister Goriot.  What may that be. said Vautrin pouncing on a letter in Christophes hand. Madam la Comtesse Anastasie de Restaud he read. Where are you going with it. he added as he gave the letter back to Christophe.  To the Rue du Helder. I have orders to give this into her hands myself.  What is there inside it. said Vautrin holding the letter up to the light. A banknote. No. He peered into the envelope. A receipted account. he cried. My word. tis a gallant old dotard. Off with you old chap he said bringing down a hand on Christophes head and spinning the man round like a thimble you will have a famous tip.  By this time the table was set. Sylvie was boiling the milk Madam Vauquer was lighting a fire in the stove with some assistance from Vautrin who kept humming to himself    The same old story everywhere    A roving heart and a roving glance.  When everything was ready Madam Couture and Mlle. Taillefer came in.  Where have you been this morning fair lady. said Madam Vauquer turning to Madam Couture.  We have just been to say our prayers at SaintEtienne du Mont. Today is the day when we must go to see Mister Taillefer. Poor little thing. She is trembling like a leaf Madam Couture went on as she seated herself before the fire and held the steaming soles of her boots to the blaze.  Warm yourself Victorine said Madam Vauquer.  It is quite right and proper mademoiselle to pray to Heaven to soften your fathers heart said Vautrin as he drew a chair nearer to the orphan girl but that is not enough. What you want is a friend who will give the monster a piece of his mind a barbarian that has three millions so they say and will not give you a dowry and a pretty girl needs a dowry nowadays.  Poor child. said Madam Vauquer. Never mind my pet your wretch of a father is going just the way to bring trouble upon himself.  Victorines eyes filled with tears at the words and the widow checked herself at a sign from Madam Couture.  If we could only see hiMister said the CommissaryGenerals widow if I could speak to him myself and give him his wifes last letter. I have never dared to run the risk of sending it by post he knew my handwriting  Oh woman persecuted and injured innocent. exclaimed Vautrin breaking in upon her. So that is how you are is it. In a few days time I will look into your affairs and it will be all right you shall see.  Oh. sir said Victorine with a tearful but eager glance at Vautrin who showed no sign of being touched by it if you know of any way of communicating with my father please be sure and tell him that his affection and my mothers honor are more to me than all the money in the world. If you can induce him to relent a little towards me I will pray to God for you. You may be sure of my gratitude  The same old story everywhere sang Vautrin with a satirical intonation. At this juncture Goriot Mlle. Michonneau and Poiret came downstairs together possibly the scent of the gravy which Sylvie was making to serve with the mutton had announced breakfast. The seven people thus assembled bade each other goodmorning and took their places at the table the clock struck ten and the students footstep was heard outside.  Ah. here you are Mister Eugene said Sylvie every one is breakfasting at home today.  The student exchanged greetings with the lodgers and sat down beside Goriot.  I have just met with a queer adventure he said as he helped himself abundantly to the mutton and cut a slice of bread which Madam Vauquers eyes gauged as usual.  An adventure. queried Poiret.  Well and what is there to astonish you in that old boy. Vautrin asked of Poiret. Mister Eugene is cut out for that kind of thing.  Mlle. Taillefer stole a timid glance at the young student.  Tell us about your adventure. demanded Mister Vautrin.  Yesterday evening I went to a ball given by a cousin of mine the Vicomtesse de Beauseant. She has a magnificent house the rooms are hung with silkin short it was a splendid affair and I was as happy as a king  Fisher put in Vautrin interrupting.  What do you mean sir. said Eugene sharply.  I said fisher because kingfishers see a good deal more fun than kings.  Quite true I would much rather be the little careless bird than a king said Poiret the dittoist because  In factthe lawstudent cut him shortI danced with one of the handsomest women in the room a charming countess the most exquisite creature I have ever seen. There was peach blossom in her hair and she had the loveliest bouquet of flowersreal flowers that scented the airbut there. it is no use trying to describe a woman glowing with the dance. You ought to have seen her. Well and this morning I met this divine countess about nine oclock on foot in the Rue de Gres. Oh. how my heart beat. I began to think  That she was coming here said Vautrin with a keen look at the student. I expect that she was going to call on old Gobseck a moneylender. If ever you explore a Parisian womans heart you will find the moneylender first and the lover afterwards. Your countess is called Anastasie de Restaud and she lives in the Rue du Helder.  The student stared hard at Vautrin. Father Goriot raised his head at the words and gave the two speakers a glance so full of intelligence and uneasiness that the lodgers beheld him with astonishment.  Then Christophe was too late and she must have gone to hiMister cried Goriot with anguish in his voice.  It is just as I guessed said Vautrin leaning over to whisper in Madam Vauquers ear.  Goriot went on with his breakfast but seemed unconscious of what he was doing. He had never looked more stupid nor more taken up with his own thoughts than he did at that moment.  Who the devil could have told you her name Mister Vautrin. asked Eugene.  Aha. there you are. answered Vautrin. Old Father Goriot there knew it quite well. and why should I not know it too.  Mister Goriot. the student cried.  What is it. asked the old man. So she was very beautiful was she yesterday night.  Who.  Madam de Restaud.  Look at the old wretch said Madam Vauquer speaking to Vautrin how his eyes light up.  Then does he really keep her. said Mlle. Michonneau in a whisper to the student.  Oh. yes she was tremendously pretty Eugene answered. Father Goriot watched him with eager eyes. If Madam de Beauseant had not been there my divine countess would have been the queen of the ball none of the younger men had eyes for any one else. I was the twelfth on her list and she danced every quadrille. The other women were furious. She must have enjoyed herself if ever creature did. It is a true saying that there is no more beautiful sight than a frigate in full sail a galloping horse or a woman dancing.  So the wheel turns said Vautrin yesterday night at a duchess ball this morning in a moneylenders office on the lowest rung of the ladderjust like a Parisienne. If their husbands cannot afford to pay for their frantic extravagance they will sell themselves. Or if they cannot do that they will tear out their mothers hearts to find something to pay for their splendor. They will turn the world upside down. Just a Parisienne through and through.  Father Goriots face which had shone at the students words like the sun on a bright day clouded over all at once at this cruel speech of Vautrins.  Well said Madam Vauquer but where is your adventure. Did you speak to her. Did you ask her if she wanted to study law.  She did not see me said Eugene. But only think of meeting one of the prettiest women in Paris in the Rue des Gres at nine oclock. She could not have reached home after the ball till two oclock this morning. Wasnt it queer. There is no place like Paris for this sort of adventures.  Pshaw. much funnier things than that happen here. exclaimed Vautrin.  Mlle. Taillefer had scarcely heeded the talk she was so absorbed by the thought of the new attempt that she was about to make. Madam Couture made a sign that it was time to go upstairs and dress the two ladies went out and Father Goriot followed their example.  Well did you see. said Madam Vauquer addressing Vautrin and the rest of the circle. He is ruining himself for those women that is plain.  Nothing will ever make me believe that that beautiful Comtesse de Restaud is anything to Father Goriot cried the student.  Well and if you dont broke in Vautrin we are not set on convincing you. You are too young to know Paris thoroughly yet later on you will find out that there are what we call men with a passion  Mlle. Michonneau gave Vautrin a quick glance at these words. They seemed to be like the sound of a trumpet to a troopers horse. Aha. said Vautrin stopping in his speech to give her a searching glance so we have had our little experiences have we.  The old maid lowered her eyes like a nun who sees a statue.  Well he went on when folk of that kind get a notion into their heads they cannot drop it. They must drink the water from some particular springit is stagnant as often as not but they will sell their wives and families they will sell their own souls to the devil to get it. For some this spring is play or the stockexchange or music or a collection of pictures or insects for others it is some woman who can give them the dainties they like. You might offer these last all the women on earththey would turn up their noses they will have the only one who can gratify their passion. It often happens that the woman does not care for them at all and treats them cruelly they buy their morsels of satisfaction very dear but no matter the fools are never tired of it they will take their last blanket to the pawnbrokers to give their last fivefranc piece to her. Father Goriot here is one of that sort. He is discreet so the Countess exploits himjust the way of the gay world. The poor old fellow thinks of her and of nothing else. In all other respects you see he is a stupid animal but get him on that subject and his eyes sparkle like diamonds. That secret is not difficult to guess. He took some plate himself this morning to the meltingpot and I saw him at Daddy Gobsecks in the Rue des Gres. And now mark what followshe came back here and gave a letter for the Comtesse de Restaud to that noodle of a Christophe who showed us the address there was a receipted bill inside it. It is clear that it was an urgent matter if the Countess also went herself to the old money lender. Father Goriot has financed her handsomely. There is no need to tack a tale together the thing is selfevident. So that shows you sir student that all the time your Countess was smiling dancing flirting swaying her peachflower crowned head with her gown gathered into her hand her slippers were pinching her as they say she was thinking of her protested bills or her lovers protested bills.  You have made me wild to know the truth cried Eugene I will go to call on Madam de Restaud tomorrow.  Yes echoed Poiret you must go and call on Madam de Restaud.  And perhaps you will find Father Goriot there who will take payment for the assistance he politely rendered.  Eugene looked disgusted. Why then this Paris of yours is a slough.  And an uncommonly queer slough too replied Vautrin. The mud splashes you as you drive through it in your carriageyou are a respectable person you go afoot and are splashedyou are a scoundrel. You are so unlucky as to walk off with something or other belonging to somebody else and they exhibit you as a curiosity in the Place du PalaisdeJustice you steal a million and you are pointed out in every salon as a model of virtue. And you pay thirty millions for the police and the courts of justice for the maintenance of law and order. A pretty slate of things it is.  What cried Madam Vauquer has Father Goriot really melted down his silver possetdish.  There were two turtledoves on the lid were there not. asked Eugene.  Yes that there were.  Then was he fond of it. said Eugene. He cried while he was breaking up the cup and plate. I happened to see him by accident.  It was dear to him as his own life answered the widow.  There. you see how infatuated the old fellow is. cried Vautrin. The woman yonder can coax the soul out of hiMister  The student went up to his rooMister Vautrin went out and a few moments later Madam Couture and Victorine drove away in a cab which Sylvie had called for theMister Poiret gave his arm to Mlle. Michonneau and they went together to spend the two sunniest hours of the day in the Jardin des Plantes.  Well those two are as good as married was the portly Sylvies comment. They are going out together today for the first time. They are such a couple of dry sticks that if they happen to strike against each other they will draw sparks like flint and steel.  Keep clear of Mlle. Michonneaus shawl then said Madam Vauquer laughing it would flare up like tinder.  At four oclock that evening when Goriot came in he saw by the light of two smoky lamps that Victorines eyes were red. Madam Vauquer was listening to the history of the visit made that morning to Mister Taillefer it had been made in vain. Taillefer was tired of the annual application made by his daughter and her elderly friend he gave them a personal interview in order to arrive at an understanding with theMister  My dear lady said Madam Couture addressing Madam Vauquer just imagine it he did not even ask Victorine to sit down she was standing the whole time. He said to me quite coolly without putting himself in a passion that we might spare ourselves the trouble of going there that the young lady he would not call her his daughter was injuring her cause by importuning him importuning. once a year the wretch. that as Victorines mother had nothing when he married her Victorine ought not to expect anything from him in fact he said the most cruel things that made the poor child burst out crying. The little thing threw herself at her fathers feet and spoke up bravely she said that she only persevered in her visits for her mothers sake that she would obey him without a murmur but that she begged him to read her poor dead mothers farewell letter. She took it up and gave it to him saying the most beautiful things in the world most beautifully expressed I do not know where she learned them God must have put them into her head for the poor child was inspired to speak so nicely that it made me cry like a fool to hear her talk. And what do you think the monster was doing all the time. Cutting his nails. He took the letter that poor Madam Taillefer had soaked with tears and flung it on to the chimneypiece. That is all right he said. He held out his hands to raise his daughter but she covered them with kisses and he drew them away again. Scandalous isnt it. And his great booby of a son came in and took no notice of his sister.  What inhuman wretches they must be. said Father Goriot.  And then they both went out of the room Madam Couture went on without heeding the worthy vermicelli makers exclamation father and son bowed to me and asked me to excuse them on account of urgent business. That is the history of our call. Well he has seen his daughter at any rate. How he can refuse to acknowledge her I cannot think for they are as alike as two peas.  The boarders dropped in one after another interchanging greetings and empty jokes that certain classes of Parisians regard as humorous and witty. Dulness is their prevailing ingredient and the whole point consists in mispronouncing a word or a gesture. This kind of argot is always changing. The essence of the jest consists in some catchword suggested by a political event an incident in the police courts a street song or a bit of burlesque at some theatre and forgotten in a month. Anything and everything serves to keep up a game of battledore and shuttlecock with words and ideas. The diorama a recent invention which carried an optical illusion a degree further than panoramas had given rise to a mania among art students for ending every word with rama. The Maison Vauquer had caught the infection from a young artist among the boarders.  Well Monsieurrr Poiret said the employe from the Museum how is your healthorama. Then without waiting for an answer he turned to Madam Couture and Victorine with a Ladies you seem melancholy.  Is dinner ready. cried Horace Bianchon a medical student and a friend of Rastignacs my stomach is sinking usque ad talones.  There is an uncommon frozerama outside said Vautrin. Make room there Father Goriot. Confound it your foot covers the whole front of the stove.  Illustrious Mister Vautrin put in Bianchon why do you say frozerama. It is incorrect it should be frozenrama.  No it shouldnt said the official from the Museum frozerama is right by the same rule that you say My feet are froze.  Ah. ah.  Here is his Excellency the Marquis de Rastignac Doctor of the Law of Contraries cried Bianchon seizing Eugene by the throat and almost throttling hiMister  Hallo there. hallo.  Mlle. Michonneau came noiselessly in bowed to the rest of the party and took her place beside the three women without saying a word.  That old bat always makes me shudder said Bianchon in a low voice indicating Mlle. Michonneau to Vautrin. I have studied Galls system and I am sure she has the bump of Judas.  Then you have seen a case before. said Vautrin.  Who has not. answered Bianchon. Upon my word that ghastly old maid looks just like one of the long worms that will gnaw a beam through give them time enough.  That is the way young man returned he of the forty years and the dyed whiskers    The rose has lived the life of a rose    A mornings space.  Aha. here is a magnificent soupeaurama cried Poiret as Christophe came in bearing the soup with cautious heed.  I beg your pardon sir said Madam Vauquer it is soupe aux choux.  All the young men roared with laughter.  Had you there Poiret.  Poirrrrette. she had you there.  Score two points to Mamma Vauquer said Vautrin.  Did any of you notice the fog this morning. asked the official.  It was a frantic fog said Bianchon a fog unparalleled doleful melancholy seagreen asthmaticala Goriot of a fog.  A Goriorama said the art student because you couldnt see a thing in it.  Hey. Milord Gaoriotte they air talking about yoooou.  Father Goriot seated at the lower end of the table close to the door through which the servant entered raised his face he had smelt at a scrap of bread that lay under his table napkin an old trick acquired in his commercial capacity that still showed itself at times.  Well Madame Vauquer cried in sharp tones that rang above the rattle of spoons and plates and the sound of other voices and is there anything the matter with the bread.  Nothing whatever madame he answered on the contrary it is made of the best quality of corn flour from Etampes.  How could you tell. asked Eugene.  By the color by the flavor.  You knew the flavor by the smell I suppose said Madam Vauquer. You have grown so economical you will find out how to live on the smell of cooking at last.  Take out a patent for it then cried the Museum official you would make a handsome fortune.  Never mind him said the artist he does that sort of thing to delude us into thinking that he was a vermicelli maker.  Your nose is a cornsampler it appears. inquired the official.  Corn what. asked Bianchon.  Cornel.  Cornet.  Cornelian.  Cornice.  Cornucopia.  Corncrake.  Corncockle.  Cornorama.  The eight responses came like a rolling fire from every part of the room and the laughter that followed was the more uproarious because poor Father Goriot stared at the others with a puzzled look like a foreigner trying to catch the meaning of words in a language which he does not understand.  Corn.... he said turning to Vautrin his next neighbor.  Corn on your foot old man. said Vautrin and he drove Father Goriots cap down over his eyes by a blow on the crown.  The poor old man thus suddenly attacked was for a moment too bewildered to do anything. Christophe carried off his plate thinking that he had finished his soup so that when Goriot had pushed back his cap from his eyes his spoon encountered the table. Every one burst out laughing. You are a disagreeable joker sir said the old man and if you take any further liberties with me  Well what then old boy. Vautrin interrupted.  Well then you shall pay dearly for it some day  Down below eh. said the artist in the little dark corner where they put naughty boys.  Well mademoiselle Vautrin said turning to Victorine you are eating nothing. So papa was refractory was he.  A monster. said Madam Couture.  Mademoiselle might make application for aliment pending her suit she is not eating anything. Eh. eh. just see how Father Goriot is staring at Mlle. Victorine.  The old man had forgotten his dinner he was so absorbed in gazing at the poor girl the sorrow in her face was unmistakablethe slighted love of a child whose father would not recognize her.  We are mistaken about Father Goriot my dear boy said Eugene in a low voice. He is not an idiot nor wanting in energy. Try your Gall system on him and let me know what you think. I saw him crush a silver dish last night as if it had been made of wax there seems to be something extraordinary going on in his mind just now to judge by his face. His life is so mysterious that it must be worth studying. Oh. you may laugh Bianchon I am not joking.  The man is a subject is he. said Bianchon all right. I will dissect him if he will give me the chance.  No feel his bumps.  HMisterhis stupidity might perhaps be contagious.    The next day Rastignac dressed himself very elegantly and about three oclock in the afternoon went to call on Madam de Restaud. On the way thither he indulged in the wild intoxicating dreams which fill a young head so full of delicious excitement. Young men at his age take no account of obstacles nor of dangers they see success in every direction imagination has free play and turns their lives into a romance they are saddened or discouraged by the collapse of one of the visionary schemes that have no existence save in their heated fancy. If youth were not ignorant and timid civilization would be impossible.  Eugene took unheardof pains to keep himself in a spotless condition but on his way through the streets he began to think about Madam de Restaud and what he should say to her. He equipped himself with wit rehearsed repartees in the course of an imaginary conversation and prepared certain neat speeches a la Talleyrand conjuring up a series of small events which should prepare the way for the declaration on which he had based his future and during these musings the law student was bespattered with mud and by the time he reached the Palais Royal he was obliged to have his boots blacked and his trousers brushed.  If I were rich he said as he changed the fivefranc piece he had brought with him in case anything might happen I would take a cab then I could think at my ease.  At last he reached the Rue du Helder and asked for the Comtesse de Restaud. He bore the contemptuous glances of the servants who had seen him cross the court on foot with the cold fury of a man who knows that he will succeed some day. He understood the meaning of their glances at once for he had felt his inferiority as soon as he entered the court where a smart cab was waiting. All the delights of life in Paris seemed to be implied by this visible and manifest sign of luxury and extravagance. A fine horse in magnificent harness was pawing the ground and all at once the law student felt out of humor with himself. Every compartment in his brain which he had thought to find so full of wit was bolted fast he grew positively stupid. He sent up his name to the Countess and waited in the antechamber standing on one foot before a window that looked out upon the court mechanically he leaned his elbow against the sash and stared before hiMister The time seemed long he would have left the house but for the southern tenacity of purpose which works miracles when it is singleminded.  Madame is in her boudoir and cannot see any one at present sir said the servant. She gave me no answer but if you will go into the diningroom there is some one already there.  Rastignac was impressed with a sense of the formidable power of the lackey who can accuse or condemn his masters by a word he coolly opened the door by which the man had just entered the antechamber meaning no doubt to show these insolent flunkeys that he was familiar with the house but he found that he had thoughtlessly precipitated himself into a small room full of dressers where lamps were standing and hotwater pipes on which towels were being dried a dark passage and a back staircase lay beyond it. Stifled laughter from the antechamber added to his confusion.  This way to the drawingroom sir said the servant with the exaggerated respect which seemed to be one more jest at his expense.  Eugene turned so quickly that he stumbled against a bath. By good luck he managed to keep his hat on his head and saved it from immersion in the water but just as he turned a door opened at the further end of the dark passage dimly lighted by a small lamp. Rastignac heard voices and the sound of a kiss one of the speakers was Madam de Restaud the other was Father Goriot. Eugene followed the servant through the diningroom into the drawingroom he went to a window that looked out into the courtyard and stood there for a while. He meant to know whether this Goriot was really the Goriot that he knew. His heart beat unwontedly fast he remembered Vautrins hideous insinuations. A welldressed young man suddenly emerged from the room almost as Eugene entered it saying impatiently to the servant who stood at the door I am going Maurice. Tell Madame la Comtesse that I waited more than half an hour for her.  Whereupon this insolent being who doubtless had a right to be insolent sang an Italian trill and went towards the window where Eugene was standing moved thereto quite as much by a desire to see the students face as by a wish to look out into the courtyard.  But Mister le Comte had better wait a moment longer madame is disengaged said Maurice as he returned to the antechamber.  Just at that moment Father Goriot appeared close to the gate he had emerged from a door at the foot of the back staircase. The worthy soul was preparing to open his umbrella regardless of the fact that the great gate had opened to admit a tilbury in which a young man with a ribbon at his buttonhole was seated. Father Goriot had scarcely time to start back and save himself. The horse took fright at the umbrella swerved and dashed forward towards the flight of steps. The young man looked round in annoyance saw Father Goriot and greeted him as he went out with constrained courtesy such as people usually show to a moneylender so long as they require his services or the sort of respect they feel it necessary to show for some one whose reputation has been blown upon so that they blush to acknowledge his acquaintance. Father Goriot gave him a little friendly nod and a goodnatured smile. All this happened with lightning speed. Eugene was so deeply interested that he forgot that he was not alone till he suddenly heard the Countess voice.  Oh. Maxime were you going away. she said reproachfully with a shade of pique in her manner. The Countess had not seen the incident nor the entrance of the tilbury. Rastignac turned abruptly and saw her standing before him coquettishly dressed in a loose white cashmere gown with knots of rosecolored ribbon here and there her hair was carelessly coiled about her head as is the wont of Parisian women in the morning there was a soft fragrance about herdoubtless she was fresh from a bathher graceful form seemed more flexible her beauty more luxuriant. Her eyes glistened. A young man can see everything at a glance he feels the radiant influence of woman as a plant discerns and absorbs its nutriment from the air he did not need to touch her hands to feel their cool freshness. He saw faint rose tints through the cashmere of the dressing gown it had fallen slightly open giving glimpses of a bare throat on which the students eyes rested. The Countess had no need of the adventitious aid of corsets her girdle defined the outlines of her slender waist her throat was a challenge to love her feet thrust into slippers were daintily small. As Maxime took her hand and kissed it Eugene became aware of Maximes existence and the Countess saw Eugene.  Oh. is that you Mister de Rastignac. I am very glad to see you she said but there was something in her manner that a shrewd observer would have taken as a hint to depart.  Maxime as the Countess Anastasie had called the young man with the haughty insolence of bearing looked from Eugene to the lady and from the lady to Eugene it was sufficiently evident that he wished to be rid of the latter. An exact and faithful rendering of the glance might be given in the words Look here my dear I hope you intend to send this little whippersnapper about his business.  The Countess consulted the young mans face with an intent submissiveness that betrays all the secrets of a womans heart and Rastignac all at once began to hate him violently. To begin with the sight of the fair carefully arranged curls on the others comely head had convinced him that his own crop was hideous Maximes boots moreover were elegant and spotless while his own in spite of all his care bore some traces of his recent walk and finally Maximes overcoat fitted the outline of his figure gracefully he looked like a pretty woman while Eugene was wearing a black coat at halfpast two. The quickwitted child of the Charente felt the disadvantage at which he was placed beside this tall slender dandy with the clear gaze and the pale face one of those men who would ruin orphan children without scruple. Madam de Restaud fled into the next room without waiting for Eugene to speak shaking out the skirts of her dressinggown in her flight so that she looked like a white butterfly and Maxime hurried after her. Eugene in a fury followed Maxime and the Countess and the three stood once more face to face by the hearth in the large drawingrooMister The law student felt quite sure that the odious Maxime found him in the way and even at the risk of displeasing Madam de Restaud he meant to annoy the dandy. It had struck him all at once that he had seen the young man before at Madam de Beauseants ball he guessed the relation between Maxime and Madam de Restaud and with the youthful audacity that commits prodigious blunders or achieves signal success he said to himself This is my rival I mean to cut him out.  Rash resolve. He did not know that Mister le Comte Maxime de Trailles would wait till he was insulted so as to fire first and kill his man. Eugene was a sportsman and a good shot but he had not yet hit the bullss eye twenty times out of twentytwo. The young Count dropped into a low chair by the hearth took up the tongs and made up the fire so violently and so sulkily that Anastasies fair face suddenly clouded over. She turned to Eugene with a cool questioning glance that asked plainly Why do you not go. a glance which wellbred people regard as a cue to make their exit.  Eugene assumed an amiable expression.  Madame he began I hastened to call upon you  He stopped short. The door opened and the owner of the tilbury suddenly appeared. He had left his hat outside and did not greet the Countess he looked meditatively at Rastignac and held out his hand to Maxime with a cordial Good morning that astonished Eugene not a little. The young provincial did not understand the amenities of a triple alliance.  Mister de Restaud said the Countess introducing her husband to the law student.  Eugene bowed profoundly.  This gentleman she continued presenting Eugene to her husband is Mister de Rastignac he is related to Madam la Vicomtesse de Beauseant through the Marcillacs I had the pleasure of meeting him at her last ball.  Related to Madam la Vicomtesse de Beauseant through the Marcillacs. These words on which the countess threw ever so slight an emphasis by reason of the pride that the mistress of a house takes in showing that she only receives people of distinction as visitors in her house produced a magical effect. The Counts stiff manner relaxed at once as he returned the students bow.  Delighted to have an opportunity of making your acquaintance he said.  Maxime de Trailles himself gave Eugene an uneasy glance and suddenly dropped his insolent manner. The mighty name had all the power of a fairys wand those closed compartments in the southern brain flew open again Rastignacs carefully drilled faculties returned. It was as if a sudden light had pierced the obscurity of this upper world of Paris and he began to see though everything was indistinct as yet. Madam Vauquers lodginghouse and Father Goriot were very far remote from his thoughts.  I thought that the Marcillacs were extinct the Comte de Restaud said addressing Eugene.  Yes they are extinct answered the law student. My greatuncle the Chevalier de Rastignac married the heiress of the Marcillac family. They had only one daughter who married the Marechal de Clarimbault Madam de Beauseants grandfather on the mothers side. We are the younger branch of the family and the younger branch is all the poorer because my greatuncle the ViceAdmiral lost all that he had in the Kings service. The Government during the Revolution refused to admit our claims when the Compagnie des Indes was liquidated.  Was not your greatuncle in command of the Vengeur before .  Yes.  Then he would be acquainted with my grandfather who commanded the Warwick.  Maxime looked at Madam de Restaud and shrugged his shoulders as who should say If he is going to discuss nautical matters with that fellow it is all over with us. Anastasie understood the glance that Mister de Trailles gave her. With a womans admirable tact she began to smile and said  Come with me Maxime I have something to say to you. We will leave you two gentlemen to sail in company on board the Warwick and the Vengeur.  She rose to her feet and signed to Maxime to follow her mirth and mischief in her whole attitude and the two went in the direction of the boudoir. The morganatic couple to use a convenient German expression which has no exact equivalent had reached the door when the Count interrupted himself in his talk with Eugene.  Anastasie. he cried pettishly just stay a moment dear you know very well that  I am coming back in a minute she interrupted I have a commission for Maxime to execute and I want to tell him about it.  She came back almost immediately. She had noticed the inflection in her husbands voice and knew that it would not be safe to retire to the boudoir like all women who are compelled to study their husbands characters in order to have their own way and whose business it is to know exactly how far they can go without endangering a good understanding she was very careful to avoid petty collisions in domestic life. It was Eugene who had brought about this untoward incident so the Countess looked at Maxime and indicated the law student with an air of exasperation. Mister de Trailles addressed the Count the Countess and Eugene with the pointed remark You are busy I do not want to interrupt you goodday and he went.  Just wait a moment Maxime. the Count called after hiMister  Come and dine with us said the Countess leaving Eugene and her husband together once more. She followed Maxime into the little drawingroom where they sat together sufficiently long to feel sure that Rastignac had taken his leave.  The law student heard their laughter and their voices and the pauses in their talk he grew malicious exerted his conversational powers for Mister de Restaud flattered him and drew him into discussions to the end that he might see the Countess again and discover the nature of her relations with Father Goriot. This Countess with a husband and a lover for Maxime clearly was her lover was a mystery. What was the secret tie that bound her to the old tradesman. This mystery he meant to penetrate hoping by its means to gain a sovereign ascendency over this fair typical Parisian.  Anastasie. the Count called again to his wife.  Poor Maxime. she said addressing the young man. Come we must resign ourselves. This evening  I hope Nasie he said in her ear that you will give orders not to admit that youngster whose eyes light up like live coals when he looks at you. He will make you a declaration and compromise you and then you will compel me to kill hiMister  Are you mad Maxime. she said. A young lad of a student is on the contrary a capital lightningconductor is not that so. Of course I mean to make Restaud furiously jealous of hiMister  Maxime burst out laughing and went out followed by the Countess who stood at the window to watch him into his carriage he shook his whip and made his horse prance. She only returned when the great gate had been closed after hiMister  What do you think dear. cried the Count her husband this gentlemans family estate is not far from Verteuil on the Charente his greatuncle and my grandfather were acquainted.  Delighted to find that we have acquaintances in common said the Countess with a preoccupied manner.  More than you think said Eugene in a low voice.  What do you mean. she asked quickly.  Why only just now said the student I saw a gentleman go out at the gate Father Goriot my next door neighbor in the house where I am lodging.  At the sound of this name and the prefix that embellished it the Count who was stirring the fire let the tongs fall as though they had burned his fingers and rose to his feet.  Sir he cried you might have called him Monsieur Goriot.  The Countess turned pale at first at the sight of her husbands vexation then she reddened clearly she was embarrassed her answer was made in a tone that she tried to make natural and with an air of assumed carelessness  You could not know any one who is dearer to us both...  She broke off glanced at the piano as if some fancy had crossed her mind and asked Are you fond of music Mister de Rastignac.  Exceedingly answered Eugene flushing and disconcerted by a dim suspicion that he had somehow been guilty of a clumsy piece of folly.  Do you sing. she cried going to the piano and sitting down before it she swept her fingers over the keyboard from end to end. Rrrrah.  No madame.  The Comte de Restaud walked to and fro.  That is a pity you are without one great means of success.Caro caaro caaaro non dubitare sang the Countess.  Eugene had a second time waved a magic wand when he uttered Goriots name but the effect seemed to be entirely opposite to that produced by the formula related to Madam de Beauseant. His position was not unlike that of some visitor permitted as a favor to inspect a private collection of curiosities when by inadvertence he comes into collision with a glass case full of sculptured figures and three or four heads imperfectly secured fall at the shock. He wished the earth would open and swallow hiMister Madam de Restauds expression was reserved and chilly her eyes had grown indifferent and sedulously avoided meeting those of the unlucky student of law.  Madame he said you wish to talk with Mister de Restaud permit me to wish you goodday  The Countess interrupted him by a gesture saying hastily Whenever you come to see us both Mister de Restaud and I shall be delighted to see you.  Eugene made a profound bow and took his leave followed by Mister de Restaud who insisted in spite of his remonstrances on accompanying him into the hall.  Neither your mistress nor I are at home to that gentleman when he calls the Count said to Maurice.  As Eugene set foot on the steps he saw that it was raining.  Come said he to himself somehow I have just made a mess of it I do not know how. And now I am going to spoil my hat and coat into the bargain. I ought to stop in my corner grind away at law and never look to be anything but a boorish country magistrate. How can I go into society when to manage properly you want a lot of cabs varnished boots gold watch chains and all sorts of things you have to wear white doeskin gloves that cost six francs in the morning and primrose kid gloves every evening. A fig for that old humbug of a Goriot.  When he reached the street door the driver of a hackney coach who had probably just deposited a wedding party at their door and asked nothing better than a chance of making a little money for himself without his employers knowledge saw that Eugene had no umbrella remarked his black coat white waistcoat yellow gloves and varnished boots and stopped and looked at him inquiringly. Eugene in the blind desperation that drives a young man to plunge deeper and deeper into an abyss as if he might hope to find a fortunate issue in its lowest depths nodded in reply to the drivers signal and stepped into the cab a few stray petals of orange blossom and scraps of wire bore witness to its recent occupation by a wedding party.  Where am I to drive sir. demanded the man who by this time had taken off his white gloves.  Confound it. Eugene said to himself I am in for it now and at least I will not spend cabhire for nothing.Drive to the Hotel Beauseant he said aloud.  Which. asked the man a portentous word that reduced Eugene to confusion. This young man of fashion species incerta did not know that there were two Hotels Beauseant he was not aware how rich he was in relations who did not care about hiMister  The Vicomte de Beauseant Rue  De Grenelle interrupted the driver with a jerk of his head. You see there are the hotels of the Marquis and Comte de Beauseant in the Rue SaintDominique he added drawing up the step.  I know all about that said Eugene severely.Everybody is laughing at me today it seems. he said to himself as he deposited his hat on the opposite seat. This escapade will cost me a kings ransom but at any rate I shall call on my socalled cousin in a thoroughly aristocratic fashion. Goriot has cost me ten francs already the old scoundrel. My word. I will tell Madam de Beauseant about my adventure perhaps it may amuse her. Doubtless she will know the secret of the criminal relation between that handsome woman and the old rat without a tail. It would be better to find favor in my cousins eyes than to come in contact with that shameless woman who seems to me to have very expensive tastes. Surely the beautiful Vicomtesses personal interest would turn the scale for me when the mere mention of her name produces such an effect. Let us look higher. If you set yourself to carry the heights of heaven you must face God.  The innumerable thoughts that surged through his brain might be summed up in these phrases. He grew calmer and recovered something of his assurance as he watched the falling rain. He told himself that though he was about to squander two of the precious fivefranc pieces that remained to him the money was well laid out in preserving his coat boots and hat and his cabmans cry of Gate if you please almost put him in spirits. A Swiss in scarlet and gold appeared the great door groaned on its hinges and Rastignac with sweet satisfaction beheld his equipage pass under the archway and stop before the flight of steps beneath the awning. The driver in a blueandred greatcoat dismounted and let down the step. As Eugene stepped out of the cab he heard smothered laughter from the peristyle. Three or four lackeys were making merry over the festal appearance of the vehicle. In another moment the law student was enlightened as to the cause of their hilarity he felt the full force of the contrast between his equipage and one of the smartest broughams in Paris a coachman with powdered hair seemed to find it difficult to hold a pair of spirited horses who stood chafing the bit. In Madam de Restauds courtyard in the Chaussee dAntin he had seen the neat turnout of a young man of sixandtwenty in the Faubourg SaintGermain he found the luxurious equipage of a man of rank thirty thousand francs would not have purchased it.  Who can be here. said Eugene to himself. He began to understand though somewhat tardily that he must not expect to find many women in Paris who were not already appropriated and that the capture of one of these queens would be likely to cost something more than bloodshed. Confound it all. I expect my cousin also has her Maxime.  He went up the steps feeling that he was a blighted being. The glass door was opened for him the servants were as solemn as jackasses under the curry comb. So far Eugene had only been in the ballroom on the ground floor of the Hotel Beauseant the fete had followed so closely on the invitation that he had not had time to call on his cousin and had therefore never seen Madam de Beauseants apartments he was about to behold for the first time a great lady among the wonderful and elegant surroundings that reveal her character and reflect her daily life. He was the more curious because Madam de Restauds drawingroom had provided him with a standard of comparison.  At halfpast four the Vicomtesse de Beauseant was visible. Five minutes earlier she would not have received her cousin but Eugene knew nothing of the recognized routine of various houses in Paris. He was conducted up the wide whitepainted crimsoncarpeted staircase between the gilded balusters and masses of flowering plants to Madam de Beauseants apartments. He did not know the rumor current about Madam de Beauseant one of the biographies told with variations in whispers every evening in the salons of Paris.  For three years past her name had been spoken of in connection with that of one of the most wealthy and distinguished Portuguese nobles the Marquis dAjudaPinto. It was one of those innocent liaisons which possess so much charm for the two thus attached to each other that they find the presence of a third person intolerable. The Vicomte de Beauseant therefore had himself set an example to the rest of the world by respecting with as good a grace as might be this morganatic union. Any one who came to call on the Vicomtesse in the early days of this friendship was sure to find the Marquis dAjudaPinto there. As under the circumstances Madam de Beauseant could not very well shut her door against these visitors she gave them such a cold reception and showed so much interest in the study of the ceiling that no one could fail to understand how much he bored her and when it became known in Paris that Madam de Beauseant was bored by callers between two and four oclock she was left in perfect solitude during that interval. She went to the Bouffons or to the Opera with Mister de Beauseant and Mister dAjudaPinto and Mister de Beauseant like a wellbred man of the world always left his wife and the Portuguese as soon as he had installed theMister But Mister dAjudaPinto must marry and a Mlle. de Rochefide was the young lady. In the whole fashionable world there was but one person who as yet knew nothing of the arrangement and that was Madam de Beauseant. Some of her friends had hinted at the possibility and she had laughed at them believing that envy had prompted those ladies to try to make mischief. And now though the bans were about to be published and although the handsome Portuguese had come that day to break the news to the Vicomtesse he had not found courage as yet to say one word about his treachery. How was it. Nothing is doubtless more difficult than the notification of an ultimatum of this kind. There are men who feel more at their ease when they stand up before another man who threatens their lives with sword or pistol than in the presence of a woman who after two hours of lamentations and reproaches falls into a dead swoon and requires salts. At this moment therefore Mister dAjudaPinto was on thorns and anxious to take his leave. He told himself that in some way or other the news would reach Madam de Beauseant he would write it would be much better to do it by letter and not to utter the words that should stab her to the heart.  So when the servant announced Mister Eugene de Rastignac the Marquis dAjudaPinto trembled with joy. To be sure a loving woman shows even more ingenuity in inventing doubts of her lover than in varying the monotony of his happiness and when she is about to be forsaken she instinctively interprets every gesture as rapidly as Virgils courser detected the presence of his companion by snuffing the breeze. It was impossible therefore that Madam de Beauseant should not detect that involuntary thrill of satisfaction slight though it was it was appalling in its artlessness.  Eugene had yet to learn that no one in Paris should present himself in any house without first making himself acquainted with the whole history of its owner and of its owners wife and family so that he may avoid making any of the terrible blunders which in Poland draw forth the picturesque exclamation Harness five bullocks to your cart. probably because you will need them all to pull you out of the quagmire into which a false step has plunged you. If down to the present day our language has no name for these conversational disasters it is probably because they are believed to be impossible the publicity given in Paris to every scandal is so prodigious. After the awkward incident at Madam de Restauds no one but Eugene could have reappeared in his character of bullockdriver in Madam de Beauseants drawingrooMister But if Madam de Restaud and Mister de Trailles had found him horribly in the way Mister dAjuda hailed his coming with relief.  Goodbye said the Portuguese hurrying to the door as Eugene made his entrance into a dainty little pinkandgray drawingroom where luxury seemed nothing more than good taste.  Until this evening said Madam de Beauseant turning her head to give the Marquis a glance. We are going to the Bouffons are we not.  I cannot go he said with his fingers on the door handle.  Madam de Beauseant rose and beckoned to him to return. She did not pay the slightest attention to Eugene who stood there dazzled by the sparkling marvels around him he began to think that this was some story out of the Arabian Nights made real and did not know where to hide himself when the woman before him seemed to be unconscious of his existence. The Vicomtesse had raised the forefinger of her right hand and gracefully signed to the Marquis to seat himself beside her. The Marquis felt the imperious sway of passion in her gesture he came back towards her. Eugene watched him not without a feeling of envy.  That is the owner of the broughaMister he said to himself. But is it necessary to have a pair of spirited horses servants in livery and torrents of gold to draw a glance from a woman here in Paris.  The demon of luxury gnawed at his heart greed burned in his veins his throat was parched with the thirst of gold.  He had a hundred and thirty francs every quarter. His father mother brothers sisters and aunt did not spend two hundred francs a month among theMister This swift comparison between his present condition and the aims he had in view helped to benumb his faculties.  Why not. the Vicomtesse was saying as she smiled at the Portuguese. Why cannot you come to the Italiens.  Affairs. I am to dine with the English Ambassador.  Throw him over.  When a man once enters on a course of deception he is compelled to add lie to lie. Mister dAjuda therefore said smiling Do you lay your commands on me.  Yes certainly.  That was what I wanted to have you say to me he answered dissembling his feelings in a glance which would have reassured any other woman.  He took the Vicomtesses hand kissed it and went.  Eugene ran his fingers through his hair and constrained himself to bow. He thought that now Madam de Beauseant would give him her attention but suddenly she sprang forward rushed to a window in the gallery and watched Mister dAjuda step into his carriage she listened to the order that he gave and heard the Swiss repeat it to the coachman  To Mister de Rochefides house.  Those words and the way in which Mister dAjuda flung himself back in the carriage were like a lightning flash and a thunderbolt for her she walked back again with a deadly fear gnawing at her heart. The most terrible catastrophes only happen among the heights. The Vicomtesse went to her own room sat down at a table and took up a sheet of dainty notepaper.     When instead of dining with the English Ambassador    she wrote you go to the Rochefides you owe me an    explanation which I am waiting to hear.   She retraced several of the letters for her hand was trembling so that they were indistinct then she signed the note with an initial C for Claire de Bourgogne and rang the bell.  Jacques she said to the servant who appeared immediately take this note to Mister de Rochefides house at halfpast seven and ask for the Marquis dAjuda. If Mister dAjuda is there leave the note without waiting for an answer if he is not there bring the note back to me.  Madame la Vicomtess there is a visitor in the drawingrooMister  Ah. yes of course she said opening the door.  Eugene was beginning to feel very uncomfortable but at last the Vicomtesse appeared she spoke to him and the tremulous tones of her voice vibrated through his heart.  Pardon me monsieur she said I had a letter to write. Now I am quite at liberty.  She scarcely knew what she was saying for even as she spoke she thought Ah. he means to marry Mlle. de Rochefide. But is he still free. This evening the marriage shall be broken off or else... But before tomorrow I shall know.  Cousin... the student replied.  Eh. said the Countess with an insolent glance that sent a cold shudder through Eugene he understood what that Eh. meant he had learned a great deal in three hours and his wits were on the alert. He reddened  Madame... he began he hesitated a moment and then went on. Pardon me I am in such need of protection that the nearest scrap of relationship could do me no harMister  Madam de Beauseant smiled but there was sadness in her smile even now she felt forebodings of the coming pain the air she breathed was heavy with the storm that was about to burst.  If you knew how my family are situated he went on you would love to play the part of a beneficent fairy godmother who graciously clears the obstacles from the path of her protege.  Well cousin she said laughing and how can I be of service to you.  But do I know even that. I am distantly related to you and this obscure and remote relationship is even now a perfect godsend to me. You have confused my ideas I cannot remember the things that I meant to say to you. I know no one else here in Paris.... Ah. if I could only ask you to counsel me ask you to look upon me as a poor child who would fain cling to the hem of your dress who would lay down his life for you.  Would you kill a man for me.  Two said Eugene.  You child. Yes you are a child she said keeping back the tears that came to her eyes you would love sincerely.  Oh. he cried flinging up his head.  The audacity of the students answer interested the Vicomtesse in hiMister The southern brain was beginning to scheme for the first time. Between Madam de Restauds blue boudoir and Madam de Beauseants rosecolored drawingroom he had made a three years advance in a kind of law which is not a recognized study in Paris although it is a sort of higher jurisprudence and when well understood is a highroad to success of every kind.  Ah. that is what I meant to say. said Eugene. I met Madam de Restaud at your ball and this morning I went to see her.  You must have been very much in the way said Madam de Beauseant smiling as she spoke.  Yes indeed. I am a novice and my blunders will set every one against me if you do not give me your counsel. I believe that in Paris it is very difficult to meet with a young beautiful and wealthy woman of fashion who would be willing to teach me what you women can explain so welllife. I shall find a Mister de Trailles everywhere. So I have come to you to ask you to give me a key to a puzzle to entreat you to tell me what sort of blunder I made this morning. I mentioned an old man  Madame la Duchess de Langeais Jacques cut the student short Eugene gave expression to his intense annoyance by a gesture.  If you mean to succeed said the Vicomtesse in a low voice in the first place you must not be so demonstrative.  Ah. good morning dear she continued and rising and crossing the room she grasped the Duchess hands as affectionately as if they had been sisters the Duchess responded in the prettiest and most gracious way.  Two intimate friends. said Rastignac to himself. Henceforward I shall have two protectresses those two women are great friends no doubt and this newcomer will doubtless interest herself in her friends cousin.  To what happy inspiration do I owe this piece of good fortune dear Antoinette. asked Madam de Beauseant.  Well I saw Mister dAjudaPinto at Mister de Rochefides door so I thought that if I came I should find you alone.  Madam de Beauseants mouth did not tighten her color did not rise her expression did not alter or rather her brow seemed to clear as the Duchess uttered those deadly words.  If I had known that you were engaged the speaker added glancing at Eugene.  This gentleman is Mister Eugene de Rastignac one of my cousins said the Vicomtesse. Have you any news of General de Montriveau. she continued. Serizy told me yesterday that he never goes anywhere now has he been to see you today.  It was believed that the Duchess was desperately in love with Mister de Montriveau and that he was a faithless lover she felt the question in her very heart and her face flushed as she answered  He was at the Elysee yesterday.  In attendance.  Claire returned the Duchess and hatred overflowed in the glances she threw at Madam de Beauseant of course you know that Mister dAjudaPinto is going to marry Mlle. de Rochefide the bans will be published tomorrow.  This thrust was too cruel the Vicomtesses face grew white but she answered laughing One of those rumors that fools amuse themselves with. What should induce Mister dAjuda to take one of the noblest names in Portugal to the Rochefides. The Rochefides were only ennobled yesterday.  But Bertha will have two hundred thousand livres a year they say.  Mister dAjuda is too wealthy to marry for money.  But my dear Mlle. de Rochefide is a charming girl.  Indeed.  And as a matter of fact he is dining with them today the thing is settled. It is very surprising to me that you should know so little about it.  Madam de Beauseant turned to Rastignac. What was the blunder that you made monsieur. she asked. The poor boy is only just launched into the world Antoinette so that he understands nothing of all this that we are speaking of. Be merciful to him and let us finish our talk tomorrow. Everything will be announced tomorrow you know and your kind informal communication can be accompanied by official confirmation.  The Duchess gave Eugene one of those insolent glances that measure a man from head to foot and leave him crushed and annihilated.  Madame I have unwittingly plunged a dagger into Madam de Restauds heart unwittinglytherein lies my offence said the student of law whose keen brain had served him sufficiently well for he had detected the biting epigrams that lurked beneath this friendly talk. You continue to receive possibly you fear those who know the amount of pain that they deliberately inflict but a clumsy blunderer who has no idea how deeply he wounds is looked upon as a fool who does not know how to make use of his opportunities and every one despises hiMister  Madam de Beauseant gave the student a glance one of those glances in which a great soul can mingle dignity and gratitude. It was like balm to the law student who was still smarting under the Duchess insolent scrutiny she had looked at him as an auctioneer might look at some article to appraise its value.  Imagine too that I had just made some progress with the Comte de Restaud for I should tell you madame he went on turning to the Duchess with a mixture of humility and malice in his manner that as yet I am only a poor devil of a student very much alone in the world and very poor  You should not tell us that Mister de Rastignac. We women never care about anything that no one else will take.  Bah. said Eugene. I am only twoandtwenty and I must make up my mind to the drawbacks of my time of life. Besides I am confessing my sins and it would be impossible to kneel in a more charming confessional you commit your sins in one drawingroom and receive absolution for them in another.  The Duchess expression grew colder she did not like the flippant tone of these remarks and showed that she considered them to be in bad taste by turning to the Vicomtesse withThis gentleman has only just come  Madam de Beauseant began to laugh outright at her cousin and at the Duchess both.  He has only just come to Paris dear and is in search of some one who will give him lessons in good taste.  Madam la Duchesse said Eugene is it not natural to wish to be initiated into the mysteries which charm us. Come now he said to himself my language is superfinely elegant Im sure.  But Madam de Restaud is herself I believe Mister de Trailles pupil said the Duchess.  Of that I had no idea madame answered the law student so I rashly came between theMister In fact I got on very well with the ladys husband and his wife tolerated me for a time until I took it into my head to tell them that I knew some one of whom I had just caught a glimpse as he went out by a back staircase a man who had given the Countess a kiss at the end of a passage.  Who was it. both women asked together.  An old man who lives at the rate of two louis a month in the Faubourg SaintMarceau where I a poor student lodge likewise. He is a truly unfortunate creature everybody laughs at himwe all call him Father Goriot.  Why child that you are cried the Vicomtesse Madam de Restaud was a Mlle. Goriot.  The daughter of a vermicelli manufacturer the Duchess added and when the little creature went to Court the daughter of a pastrycook was presented on the same day. Do you remember Claire. The King began to laugh and made some joke in Latin about flour. Peoplewhat was it.people  Ejusdem farinoe said Eugene.  Yes that was it said the Duchess.  Oh. is that her father. the law student continued aghast.  Yes certainly the old man had two daughters he dotes on them so to speak though they will scarcely acknowledge hiMister  Didnt the second daughter marry a banker with a German name. the Vicomtesse asked turning to Madam de Langeais a Baron de Nucingen. And her name is Delphine is it not. Isnt she a fairhaired woman who has a sidebox at the Opera. She comes sometimes to the Bouffons and laughs loudly to attract attention.  The Duchess smiled and said  I wonder at you dear. Why do you take so much interest in people of that kind. One must have been as madly in love as Restaud was to be infatuated with Mlle. Anastasie and her flour sacks. Oh. he will not find her a good bargain. She is in Mister de Trailles hands and he will ruin her.  And they do not acknowledge their father. Eugene repeated.  Oh. well yes their father the father a father replied the Vicomtesse a kind father who gave them each five or six hundred thousand francs it is said to secure their happiness by marrying them well while he only kept eight or ten thousand livres a year for himself thinking that his daughters would always be his daughters thinking that in them he would live his life twice over again that in their houses he should find two homes where he would be loved and looked up to and made much of. And in two years time both his sonsinlaw had turned him out of their houses as if he were one of the lowest outcasts.  Tears came into Eugenes eyes. He was still under the spell of youthful beliefs he had just left home pure and sacred feelings had been stirred within him and this was his first day on the battlefield of civilization in Paris. Genuine feeling is so infectious that for a moment the three looked at each other in silence.  Eh mon Dieu. said Madam de Langeais yes it seems very horrible and yet we see such things every day. Is there not a reason for it. Tell me dear have you ever really thought what a soninlaw is. A soninlaw is the man for whom we bring up you and I a dear little one bound to us very closely in innumerable ways for seventeen years she will be the joy of her family its white soul as Lamartine says and suddenly she will become its scourge. When HE comes and takes her from us his love from the very beginning is like an axe laid to the root of all the old affection in our darlings heart and all the ties that bound her to her family are severed. But yesterday our little daughter thought of no one but her mother and father as we had no thought that was not for her by tomorrow she will have become a hostile stranger. The tragedy is always going on under our eyes. On the one hand you see a father who has sacrificed himself to his son and his daughterinlaw shows him the last degree of insolence. On the other hand it is the soninlaw who turns his wifes mother out of the house. I sometimes hear it said that there is nothing dramatic about society in these days but the Drama of the Soninlaw is appalling to say nothing of our marriages which have come to be very poor farces. I can explain how it all came about in the old vermicelli makers case. I think I recollect that Foriot  Goriot madame.  Yes that Moriot was once President of his Section during the Revolution. He was in the secret of the famous scarcity of grain and laid the foundation of his fortune in those days by selling flour for ten times its cost. He had as much flour as he wanted. My grandmothers steward sold him immense quantities. No doubt Noriot shared the plunder with the Committee of Public Salvation as that sort of person always did. I recollect the steward telling my grandmother that she might live at Grandvilliers in complete security because her corn was as good as a certificate of civisMister Well then this Loriot who sold corn to those butchers has never had but one passion they sayhe idolizes his daughters. He settled one of them under Restauds roof and grafted the other into the Nucingen family tree the Baron de Nucingen being a rich banker who had turned Royalist. You can quite understand that so long as Bonaparte was Emperor the two sonsinlaw could manage to put up with the old Ninetythree but after the restoration of the Bourbons Mister de Restaud felt bored by the old mans society and the banker was still more tired of it. His daughters were still fond of him they wanted to keep the goat and the cabbage so they used to see Joriot whenever there was no one there under pretence of affection. Come today papa we shall have you all to ourselves and that will be much nicer. and all that sort of thing. As for me dear I believe that love has secondsight poor Ninetythree his heart must have bled. He saw that his daughters were ashamed of him that if they loved their husbands his visits must make mischief. So he immolated himself. He made the sacrifice because he was a father he went into voluntary exile. His daughters were satisfied so he thought that he had done the best thing he could but it was a family crime and father and daughters were accomplices. You see this sort of thing everywhere. What could this old Doriot have been but a splash of mud in his daughters drawingrooms. He would only have been in the way and bored other people besides being bored himself. And this that happened between father and daughters may happen to the prettiest woman in Paris and the man she loves the best if her love grows tiresome he will go he will descend to the basest trickery to leave her. It is the same with all love and friendship. Our heart is a treasury if you pour out all its wealth at once you are bankrupt. We show no more mercy to the affection that reveals its utmost extent than we do to another kind of prodigal who has not a penny left. Their father had given them all he had. For twenty years he had given his whole heart to them then one day he gave them all his fortune too. The lemon was squeezed the girls left the rest in the gutter.  The world is very base said the Vicomtesse plucking at the threads of her shawl. She did not raise her head as she spoke the words that Madam de Langeais had meant for her in the course of her story had cut her to the quick.  Base. Oh no answered the Duchess the world goes its own way that is all. If I speak in this way it is only to show that I am not duped by it. I think as you do she said pressing the Vicomtesses hand. The world is a slough let us try to live on the heights above it.  She rose to her feet and kissed Madam de Beauseant on the forehead as she said You look very charming today dear. I have never seen such a lovely color in your cheeks before.  Then she went out with a slight inclination of the head to the cousin.  Father Goriot is sublime. said Eugene to himself as he remembered how he had watched his neighbor work the silver vessel into a shapeless mass that night.  Madam de Beauseant did not hear him she was absorbed in her own thoughts. For several minutes the silence remained unbroken till the law student became almost paralyzed with embarrassment and was equally afraid to go or stay or speak a word.  The world is basely ungrateful and illnatured said the Vicomtesse at last. No sooner does a trouble befall you than a friend is ready to bring the tidings and to probe your heart with the point of a dagger while calling on you to admire the handle. Epigrams and sarcasms already. Ah. I will defend myself.  She raised her head like the great lady that she was and lightnings flashed from her proud eyes.  Ah. she said as she saw Eugene are you there.  Still he said piteously.  Well then Mister de Rastignac deal with the world as it deserves. You are determined to succeed. I will help you. You shall sound the depths of corruption in woman you shall measure the extent of mans pitiful vanity. Deeply as I am versed in such learning there were pages in the book of life that I had not read. Now I know all. The more coldblooded your calculations the further you will go. Strike ruthlessly you will be feared. Men and women for you must be nothing more than posthorses take a fresh relay and leave the last to drop by the roadside in this way you will reach the goal of your ambition. You will be nothing here you see unless a woman interests herself in you and she must be young and wealthy and a woman of the world. Yet if you have a heart lock it carefully away like a treasure do not let any one suspect it or you will be lost you would cease to be the executioner you would take the victims place. And if ever you should love never let your secret escape you. Trust no one until you are very sure of the heart to which you open your heart. Learn to mistrust every one take every precaution for the sake of the love which does not exist as yet. Listen Miguelthe name slipped from her so naturally that she did not notice her mistakethere is something still more appalling than the ingratitude of daughters who have cast off their old father and wish that he were dead and that is a rivalry between two sisters. Restaud comes of a good family his wife has been received into their circle she has been presented at court and her sister her wealthy sister Madam Delphine de Nucingen the wife of a great capitalist is consumed with envy and ready to die of spleen. There is gulf set between the sistersindeed they are sisters no longerthe two women who refuse to acknowledge their father do not acknowledge each other. So Madam de Nucingen would lap up all the mud that lies between the Rue SaintLazare and the Rue de Grenelle to gain admittance to my salon. She fancied that she should gain her end through de Marsay she has made herself de Marsays slave and she bores hiMister De Marsay cares very little about her. If you will introduce her to me you will be her darling her Benjamin she will idolize you. If after that you can love her do so if not make her useful. I will ask her to come once or twice to one of my great crushes but I will never receive her here in the morning. I will bow to her when I see her and that will be quite sufficient. You have shut the Comtesse de Restauds door against you by mentioning Father Goriots name. Yes my good friend you may call at her house twenty times and every time out of the twenty you will find that she is not at home. The servants have their orders and will not admit you. Very well then now let Father Goriot gain the right of entry into her sisters house for you. The beautiful Madam de Nucingen will give the signal for a battle. As soon as she singles you out other women will begin to lose their heads about you and her enemies and rivals and intimate friends will all try to take you from her. There are women who will fall in love with a man because another woman has chosen him like the city madams poor things who copy our millinery and hope thereby to acquire our manners. You will have a success and in Paris success is everything it is the key of power. If the women credit you with wit and talent the men will follow suit so long as you do not undeceive them yourself. There will be nothing you may not aspire to you will go everywhere and you will find out what the world isan assemblage of fools and knaves. But you must be neither the one nor the other. I am giving you my name like Ariadnes clue of thread to take with you into the labyrinth make no unworthy use of it she said with a queenly glance and curve of her throat give it back to me unsullied. And now go leave me. We women also have our battles to fight.  And if you should ever need some one who would gladly set a match to a train for you  Well. she asked.  He tapped his heart smiled in answer to his cousins smile and went.  It was five oclock and Eugene was hungry he was afraid lest he should not be in time for dinner a misgiving which made him feel that it was pleasant to be borne so quickly across Paris. This sensation of physical comfort left his mind free to grapple with the thoughts that assailed hiMister A mortification usually sends a young man of his age into a furious rage he shakes his fist at society and vows vengeance when his belief in himself is shaken. Just then Rastignac was overwhelmed by the words You have shut the Countess door against you.  I shall call. he said to himself and if Madam de Beauseant is right if I never find her at homeI... well Madam de Restaud shall meet me in every salon in Paris. I will learn to fence and have some pistol practice and kill that Maxime of hers.  And money. cried an inward monitor. How about money where is that to come froMister And all at once the wealth displayed in the Countess de Restauds drawingroom rose before his eyes. That was the luxury which Goriots daughter had loved too well the gilding the ostentatious splendor the unintelligent luxury of the parvenu the riotous extravagance of a courtesan. Then the attractive vision suddenly went under an eclipse as he remembered the stately grandeur of the Hotel de Beauseant. As his fancy wandered among these lofty regions in the great world of Paris innumerable dark thoughts gathered in his heart his ideas widened and his conscience grew more elastic. He saw the world as it is saw how the rich lived beyond the jurisdiction of law and public opinion and found in success the ultima ratio mundi.  Vautrin is right success is virtue. he said to himself.    Arrived in the Rue NeuveSainteGenevieve he rushed up to his room for ten francs wherewith to satisfy the demands of the cabman and went in to dinner. He glanced round the squalid room saw the eighteen povertystricken creatures about to feed like cattle in their stalls and the sight filled him with loathing. The transition was too sudden and the contrast was so violent that it could not but act as a powerful stimulant his ambition developed and grew beyond all social bounds. On the one hand he beheld a vision of social life in its most charming and refined forms of quickpulsed youth of fair impassioned faces invested with all the charm of poetry framed in a marvelous setting of luxury or art and on the other hand he saw a sombre picture the miry verge beyond these faces in which passion was extinct and nothing was left of the drama but the cords and pulleys and bare mechanisMister Madam de Beauseants counsels the words uttered in anger by the forsaken lady her petulant offer came to his mind and poverty was a ready expositor. Rastignac determined to open two parallel trenches so as to insure success he would be a learned doctor of law and a man of fashion. Clearly he was still a child. Those two lines are asymptotes and will never meet.  You are very dull my lord Marquis said Vautrin with one of the shrewd glances that seem to read the innermost secrets of another mind.  I am not in the humor to stand jokes from people who call me my lord Marquis answered Eugene. A marquis here in Paris if he is not the veriest sham ought to have a hundred thousand livres a year at least and a lodger in the Maison Vauquer is not exactly Fortunes favorite.  Vautrins glance at Rastignac was halfpaternal halfcontemptuous. Puppy. it seemed to say I should make one mouthful of hiMister Then he answered  You are in a bad humor perhaps your visit to the beautiful Comtesse de Restaud was not a success.  She has shut her door against me because I told her that her father dined at our table cried Rastignac.  Glances were exchanged all round the room Father Goriot looked down.  You have sent some snuff into my eye he said to his neighbor turning a little aside to rub his hand over his face.  Any one who molests Father Goriot will have henceforward to reckon with me said Eugene looking at the old mans neighbor he is worth all the rest of us put together.I am not speaking of the ladies he added turning in the direction of Mlle. Taillefer.  Eugenes remarks produced a sensation and his tone silenced the dinnertable. Vautrin alone spoke. If you are going to champion Father Goriot and set up for his responsible editor into the bargain you had need be a crack shot and know how to handle the foils he said banteringly.  So I intend said Eugene.  Then you are taking the field today.  Perhaps Rastignac answered. But I owe no account of myself to any one especially as I do not try to find out what other people do of a night.  Vautrin looked askance at Rastignac.  If you do not mean to be deceived by the puppets my boy you must go behind and see the whole show and not peep through holes in the curtain. That is enough he added seeing that Eugene was about to fly into a passion. We can have a little talk whenever you like.  There was a general feeling of gloom and constraint. Father Goriot was so deeply dejected by the students remark that he did not notice the change in the disposition of his fellowlodgers nor know that he had met with a champion capable of putting an end to the persecution.  Then Mister Goriot sitting there is the father of a countess said Madam Vauquer in a low voice.  And of a baroness answered Rastignac.  That is about all he is capable of said Bianchon to Rastignac I have taken a look at his head there is only one bumpthe bump of Paternity he must be an eternal father.  Eugene was too intent on his thoughts to laugh at Bianchons joke. He determined to profit by Madam de Beauseants counsels and was asking himself how he could obtain the necessary money. He grew grave. The wide savannas of the world stretched before his eyes all things lay before him nothing was his. Dinner came to an end the others went and he was left in the diningrooMister  So you have seen my daughter. Goriot spoke tremulously and the sound of his voice broke in upon Eugenes dreams. The young man took the elders hand and looked at him with something like kindness in his eyes.  You are a good and noble man he said. We will have some talk about your daughters by and by.  He rose without waiting for Goriots answer and went to his rooMister There he wrote the following letter to his mother    My Dear MotherCan you nourish your child from your breast   again. I am in a position to make a rapid fortune but I want   twelve hundred francsI must have them at all costs. Say nothing   about this to my father perhaps he might make objections and   unless I have the money I may be led to put an end to myself and   so escape the clutches of despair. I will tell you everything when   I see you. I will not begin to try to describe my present   situation it would take volumes to put the whole story clearly   and fully. I have not been gambling my kind mother I owe no one   a penny but if you would preserve the life that you gave me you   must send me the sum I mention. As a matter of fact I go to see   the Vicomtesse de Beauseant she is using her influence for me I   am obliged to go into society and I have not a penny to lay out   on clean gloves. I can manage to exist on bread and water or go   without food if need be but I cannot do without the tools with   which they cultivate the vineyards in this country. I must   resolutely make up my mind at once to make my way or stick in the   mire for the rest of my days. I know that all your hopes are set   on me and I want to realize them quickly. Sell some of your old   jewelry my kind mother I will give you other jewels very soon. I   know enough of our affairs at home to know all that such a   sacrifice means and you must not think that I would lightly ask   you to make it I should be a monster if I could. You must think   of my entreaty as a cry forced from me by imperative necessity.   Our whole future lies in the subsidy with which I must begin my   first campaign for life in Paris is one continual battle. If you   cannot otherwise procure the whole of the money and are forced to   sell our aunts lace tell her that I will send her some still   handsomer and so forth.  He wrote to ask each of his sisters for their savingswould they despoil themselves for him and keep the sacrifice a secret from the family. To his request he knew that they would not fail to respond gladly and he added to it an appeal to their delicacy by touching the chord of honor that vibrates so loudly in young and highstrung natures.  Yet when he had written the letters he could not help feeling misgivings in spite of his youthful ambition his heart beat fast and he trembled. He knew the spotless nobleness of the lives buried away in the lonely manor house he knew what trouble and what joy his request would cause his sisters and how happy they would be as they talked at the bottom of the orchard of that dear brother of theirs in Paris. Visions rose before his eyes a sudden strong light revealed his sisters secretly counting over their little store devising some girlish stratagem by which the money could be sent to him incognito essaying for the first time in their lives a piece of deceit that reached the sublime in its unselfishness.  A sisters heart is a diamond for purity a deep sea of tenderness. he said to himself. He felt ashamed of those letters.  What power there must be in the petitions put up by such hearts how pure the fervor that bears their souls to Heaven in prayer. What exquisite joy they would find in selfsacrifice. What a pang for his mothers heart if she could not send him all that he asked for. And this noble affection these sacrifices made at such terrible cost were to serve as the ladder by which he meant to climb to Delphine de Nucingen. A few tears like the last grains of incense flung upon the sacred alter fire of the hearth fell from his eyes. He walked up and down and despair mingled with his emotion. Father Goriot saw him through the halfopen door.  What is the matter sir. he asked from the threshold.  Ah. my good neighbor I am as much a son and brother as you are a father. You do well to fear for the Comtesse Anastasie there is one Mister Maxime de Trailles who will be her ruin.  Father Goriot withdrew stammering some words but Eugene failed to catch their meaning.  The next morning Rastignac went out to post his letters. Up to the last moment he wavered and doubted but he ended by flinging them into the box. I shall succeed. he said to himself. So says the gambler so says the great captain but the three words that have been the salvation of some few have been the ruin of many more.  A few days after this Eugene called at Madam de Restauds house she was not at home. Three times he tried the experiment and three times he found her doors closed against him though he was careful to choose an hour when Mister de Trailles was not there. The Vicomtesse was right.  The student studied no longer. He put in an appearance at lectures simply to answer to his name and after thus attesting his presence departed forthwith. He had been through a reasoning process familiar to most students. He had seen the advisability of deferring his studies to the last moment before going up for his examinations he made up his mind to cram his second and third years work into the third year when he meant to begin to work in earnest and to complete his studies in law with one great effort. In the meantime he had fifteen months in which to navigate the ocean of Paris to spread the nets and set the lines that would bring him a protectress and a fortune. Twice during that week he saw Madam de Beauseant he did not go to her house until he had seen the Marquis dAjuda drive away.  Victory for yet a few more days was with the great lady the most poetic figure in the Faubourg SaintGermain and the marriage of the Marquis dAjudaPinto with Mlle. de Rochefide was postponed. The dread of losing her happiness filled those days with a fever of joy unknown before but the end was only so much the nearer. The Marquis dAjuda and the Rochefides agreed that this quarrel and reconciliation was a very fortunate thing Madam de Beauseant so they hoped would gradually become reconciled to the idea of the marriage and in the end would be brought to sacrifice dAjudas morning visits to the exigencies of a mans career exigencies which she must have foreseen. In spite of the most solemn promises daily renewed Mister dAjuda was playing a part and the Vicomtesse was eager to be deceived. Instead of taking a leap heroically from the window she is falling headlong down the staircase said her most intimate friend the Duchesse de Langeais. Yet this afterglow of happiness lasted long enough for the Vicomtesse to be of service to her young cousin. She had a halfsuperstitious affection for hiMister Eugene had shown her sympathy and devotion at a crisis when a woman sees no pity no real comfort in any eyes when if a man is ready with soothing flatteries it is because he has an interested motive.  Rastignac made up his mind that he must learn the whole of Goriots previous history he would come to his bearings before attempting to board the Maison de Nucingen. The results of his inquiries may be given briefly as follows  In the days before the Revolution JeanJoachim Goriot was simply a workman in the employ of a vermicelli maker. He was a skilful thrifty workman sufficiently enterprising to buy his masters business when the latter fell a chance victim to the disturbances of . Goriot established himself in the Rue de la Jussienne close to the Corn Exchange. His plain good sense led him to accept the position of President of the Section so as to secure for his business the protection of those in power at that dangerous epoch. This prudent step had led to success the foundations of his fortune were laid in the time of the Scarcity real or artificial when the price of grain of all kinds rose enormously in Paris. People used to fight for bread at the bakers doors while other persons went to the grocers shops and bought Italian paste foods without brawling over it. It was during this year that Goriot made the money which at a later time was to give him all the advantage of the great capitalist over the small buyer he had moreover the usual luck of average ability his mediocrity was the salvation of hiMister He excited no ones envy it was not even suspected that he was rich till the peril of being rich was over and all his intelligence was concentrated not on political but on commercial speculations. Goriot was an authority second to none on all questions relating to corn flour and middlings and the production storage and quality of grain. He could estimate the yield of the harvest and foresee market prices he bought his cereals in Sicily and imported Russian wheat. Any one who had heard him hold forth on the regulations that control the importation and exportation of grain who had seen his grasp of the subject his clear insight into the principles involved his appreciation of weak points in the way that the system worked would have thought that here was the stuff of which a minister is made. Patient active and persevering energetic and prompt in action he surveyed his business horizon with an eagle eye. Nothing there took him by surprise he foresaw all things knew all that was happening and kept his own counsel he was a diplomatist in his quick comprehension of a situation and in the routine of business he was as patient and plodding as a soldier on the march. But beyond this business horizon he could not see. He used to spend his hours of leisure on the threshold of his shop leaning against the framework of the door. Take him from his dark little countinghouse and he became once more the rough slowwitted workman a man who cannot understand a piece of reasoning who is indifferent to all intellectual pleasures and falls asleep at the play a Parisian Dolibom in short against whose stupidity other minds are powerless.  Natures of this kind are nearly all alike in almost all of them you will find some hidden depth of sublime affection. Two allabsorbing affections filled the vermicelli makers heart to the exclusion of every other feeling into them he seemed to put all the forces of his nature as he put the whole power of his brain into the corn trade. He had regarded his wife the only daughter of a rich farmer of La Brie with a devout admiration his love for her had been boundless. Goriot had felt the charm of a lovely and sensitive nature which in its delicate strength was the very opposite of his own. Is there any instinct more deeply implanted in the heart of man than the pride of protection a protection which is constantly exerted for a fragile and defenceless creature. Join love thereto the warmth of gratitude that all generous souls feel for the source of their pleasures and you have the explanation of many strange incongruities in human nature.  After seven years of unclouded happiness Goriot lost his wife. It was very unfortunate for hiMister She was beginning to gain an ascendency over him in other ways possibly she might have brought that barren soil under cultivation she might have widened his ideas and given other directions to his thoughts. But when she was dead the instinct of fatherhood developed in him till it almost became a mania. All the affection balked by death seemed to turn to his daughters and he found full satisfaction for his heart in loving theMister More or less brilliant proposals were made to him from time to time wealthy merchants or farmers with daughters vied with each other in offering inducements to him to marry again but he determined to remain a widower. His fatherinlaw the only man for whom he felt a decided friendship gave out that Goriot had made a vow to be faithful to his wifes memory. The frequenters of the Corn Exchange who could not comprehend this sublime piece of folly joked about it among themselves and found a ridiculous nickname for hiMister One of them ventured after a glass over a bargain to call him by it and a blow from the vermicelli makers fist sent him headlong into a gutter in the Rue Oblin. He could think of nothing else when his children were concerned his love for them made him fidgety and anxious and this was so well known that one day a competitor who wished to get rid of him to secure the field to himself told Goriot that Delphine had just been knocked down by a cab. The vermicelli maker turned ghastly pale left the Exchange at once and did not return for several days afterwards he was ill in consequence of the shock and the subsequent relief on discovering that it was a false alarMister This time however the offender did not escape with a bruised shoulder at a critical moment in the mans affairs Goriot drove him into bankruptcy and forced him to disappear from the Corn Exchange.  As might have been expected the two girls were spoiled. With an income of sixty thousand francs Goriot scarcely spent twelve hundred on himself and found all his happiness in satisfying the whims of the two girls. The best masters were engaged that Anastasie and Delphine might be endowed with all the accomplishments which distinguish a good education. They had a chaperonluckily for them she was a woman who had good sense and good tastethey learned to ride they had a carriage for their use they lived as the mistress of a rich old lord might live they had only to express a wish their father would hasten to give them their most extravagant desires and asked nothing of them in return but a kiss. Goriot had raised the two girls to the level of the angels and quite naturally he himself was left beneath theMister Poor man. he loved them even for the pain that they gave hiMister  When the girls were old enough to be married they were left free to choose for themselves. Each had half her fathers fortune as her dowry and when the Comte de Restaud came to woo Anastasie for her beauty her social aspirations led her to leave her fathers house for a more exalted sphere. Delphine wished for money she married Nucingen a banker of German extraction who became a Baron of the Holy Roman Empire. Goriot remained a vermicelli maker as before. His daughters and his sonsinlaw began to demur they did not like to see him still engaged in trade though his whole life was bound up with his business. For five years he stood out against their entreaties then he yielded and consented to retire on the amount realized by the sale of his business and the savings of the last few years. It was this capital that Madam Vauquer in the early days of his residence with her had calculated would bring in eight or ten thousand livres in a year. He had taken refuge in her lodginghouse driven there by despair when he knew that his daughters were compelled by their husbands not only to refuse to receive him as an inmate in their houses but even to see him no more except in private.  This was all the information which Rastignac gained from a Mister Muret who had purchased Goriots business information which confirmed the Duchesse de Langeais suppositions and herewith the preliminary explanation of this obscure but terrible Parisian tragedy comes to an end.
